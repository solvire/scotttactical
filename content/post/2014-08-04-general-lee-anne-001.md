Here we go.

1969 hugger orange rust bucket.

This thing barely stops.  It stops when it wants to.  So it's kinda like a woman.  Every bushing and joint is shot.  Probably never replaced a thing on it.

And the adventure begins.  I'm using this truck as the first in my branded line of modified restorations.  Our focus for these trucks is somewhere in between utility and aesthetics.  Not just a mall crawler but something of a useful truck that also gets attention.  I will be formulating various levels of offerings so that we can set our branded restorations.  We can go all the way or just get it back to top mechanical levels and clean of rust.
