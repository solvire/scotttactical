# Taking Pictures at the Sepulveda Dam

Did a little scouting and shooting photography yesterday morning.

Just a couple highlights.Â  I am of course shooting with my Canon EOS 60D

The fog was enough all by itself. I wished I could have stuck around for more of that. I will come back just for the morning fog and do a timelapse at some point. </P
