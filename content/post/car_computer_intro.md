## Introduction To STAC Car Computer

The purpose of the build out is to take a 100% analog vehicle and bring in modern creature comforts and a modern driveline. In addition to this I will be integrating a few technology tools that are developed at my current work.  

### Scenario

In the morning I would like to walk out to my car, walk up to the door and have it unlock for me. If it greeted me in Jarvis' voice from Ironman I would like that too.  

When it sees me leave, I would like to be a little sad and then lock the door.


That is to be determined.

### Features

Below are the features that I would like to have in place for the acceptable delivery.

* OBD2 Integration
* Biometric Entry (Face Unlock)
* Keyless Entry
* Alarm
* Stereo Setup
* Navigation
* IoT Syncing
* Anti-Theft
* Blackbox Recording
* Driving and Backup Cameras
* Steering Wheel Controls
* Accelerometer - axis tilt


## Research

Obviously this was a research heavy experiment. I didn't really know how I was going to go about it. And there aren't a ton of plug&play solutions. Which I kinda liked.  I used to help my dad build computers as a kid.  Actually I just used to hand him stuff and sit there bored.  Fun fact - back then the computers weighed as much as my car.

### Resources

I will add to these from time to time. This is probably the only section I will update long term.

#### Hardware

#### Reasonable PCs


A $250 PC with a solid power supply.

This is what I eventually went with some days later:

#### Locked Down Hardware


These seem to be custom built specifically for car integration.

2-3 week lead time. Too tight for our needs.

#### Batteries Not Included

Nice components. But I would have to assemble everything myself.

UK. probably wouldn't get here in time.

#### Automotive Specific

Car TFT had a lot of full featured components such as navigation.
They also had hardened computers that would end up in the Way Too Expensive category

#### The Way Too Expensive

This one is their mini rugged coming in at almost $1400!

https://www.spartonre.com/littlepcs/fanless-mini-pcs/lpc-810-ultra-small-rugged-fanless-mini-pc/


A great option but a little bit outside the price range.

* $478.00
* Quad-Core Intel Pentium N4200 processor
* Dual LAN, options for 4G, Movidius, and multi-CEC functionality
* TPM via Intel Platform Trust Technology

#### Software


Google Android

https://www.android.com/auto/
It looks like they are making a very weak attempt at entering the market.


#### Suites

Carberry

http://www.carberry.it/

This one looks to be the most full featured.
