# Car Computer Introduction

The purpose of the build out is to take a 100% analog vehicle and bring in modern creature comforts and a modern driveline. In addition to this I will be integrating a few technology tools that are developed at my current work.  

## Scenario

In the morning I would like to walk out to my car, walk up to the door and have it unlock for me. If it greeted me in Jarvis' voice from Ironman I would like that too.  

When it sees me leave, I would like to be a little sad and then lock the door.


That is to be determined.

## Features

Below are the features that I would like to have in place for the acceptable delivery.

* OBD2 Integration
* Biometric Entry (Face Unlock)
* Keyless Entry
* Alarm
* Stereo Setup
* Navigation
* IoT Syncing
* Anti-Theft
* Blackbox Recording
* Driving and Backup Cameras
* Steering Wheel Controls
* Accelerometer - axis tilt


# Research

Obviously this was a research heavy experiment. I didn't really know how I was going to go about it. And there aren't a ton of plug&play solutions. Which I kinda liked.  I used to help my dad build computers as a kid.  Actually I just used to hand him stuff and sit there bored.  Fun fact - back then the computers weighed as much as my car.

## Resources

I will add to these from time to time. This is probably the only section I will update long term.

### Hardware

#### Reasonable PCs


A $250 PC with a solid power supply.

#### Locked Down Hardware


These seem to be custom built specifically for car integration.

2-3 week lead time. Too tight for our needs.

#### Batteries Not Included

Nice components. But I would have to assemble everything myself.

UK. probably wouldn't get here in time.

#### The Way Too Expensive

This one is their mini rugged coming in at almost $1400!

### Software


Google Android

It looks like they are making a very weak attempt at entering the market.


### Suites

Carberry

This one looks to be the most full featured.
