## Building a Dana Sixty

Part of this process was setting up the new axles.
I wanted to go 1-ton all the way around.
I think everyone knows that finding a good condition d60 for a reasonable price is not possible.

So I bought one from a local guy that had been sitting on a truck in a paintball field. It looked like it was pulled from Davey Jones Locker Room.
