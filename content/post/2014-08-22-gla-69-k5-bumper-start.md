Well, we got the truck running enough that I can drive it around.  It stops. We even locked it up and watched the black lines form up behind the tires. Not bad for 35's.

It was moved over to Camarillo to the shop known as [Mercenary Offroad][1] where a custom bumper will be fabricated for it.  The designator for this bumper is also 001 as it will be the first one designed for this series truck.  I have wanted to have one of these commissioned.  The real-use high-clearance bumpers that are going on the HD dodge trucks are works of art.  I'm glad to be helping in this endeavor.  In only the fact that I showed up with the truck I still helped. Right?

I ripped off the front bumper.  Apparently they had bumped something and it tweaked the tip of the frame a little bit.  So conclusion is that bumper was not stock. So no purists get on me for original steel. Just getting ahead of you all. It took two of strapping young men and a breaker bar to get that bumper to come off.  [Pismo Beach][2] and saltwear and sandwear.

To my horror the rear bumper was easy to get off.  In fact it was only being held on finger tight. A few bumps and it would have just been left on the highway.  Oh well. Time for new hardware.
