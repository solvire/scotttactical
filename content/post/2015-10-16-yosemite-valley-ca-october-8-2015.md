The first full day of hiking and taking pictures in Yosemite. We realized that we weren't going to get a spot for the second day so we decided to save our energy on the valley floor and walk around taking photos. Most of the animals were amazingly friendly. The weather was absolutely amazing as well.

My advice is to book well in advance. Scout out the campsites by google maps if you can and get a good spot. That makes the trip so much better.
