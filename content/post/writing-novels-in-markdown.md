## Writing in Markdown

If you haven't used [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to write in a rich(er) text format, then you are missing out. I pretty much write all my technical documentation in Markdown. It's pretty awesome and I don't know why it took me so long to find it. I didn't start using it until around 2013.

### What is Markdown

Markdown was created by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber).

According to Wikipedia.

> John Gruber created the [Markdown language](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)‚Äù

What does that even mean? Well it just means it is plain text that has a few symbols to make it mean something more. Once you write a little of it then it's much easier.

I'm still not sure how DaringFireball made any money, but I guess once you get traffic it's all gravy.

## The Objectives

### Time Management

I write on various applications and in various places. I am always just jotting stuff down in Evernote, voice notes on my phone, sketching on my Post-it pad, etc.  I'm totally distributed. I think everywhere so I might as well be able to write everywhere.

There are so few minutes of available time in my day that I want to make use of them. If I tallied up all my available time in a day and aggregated it I would have easily written a few novels by now. But that is another topic.

### Deficiency Analysis

I tried to identify all the areas that were keeping me from writing.  The biggest was obviously motivation and getting back in the flow. I fail the biggest recommendation I have read: write every day.

The second problem was my editor sucked. I was using OpenOfficeArg. Totally a busted app now. Sorry guys. Time to ditch you.

The third problem was that my project was getting too ambitious and I couldn't keep all the links to the ideas. Part of that reason was the gaps in writing time.

## Workflow

This is my proposed workflow. It will be adjusted over time.

1. break every chapter apart into it's own file
2. start a new chapter
3. provide headers with tags and various elements
4. with a script fill the headers with any markdown notes
5. use the headers to link the files together
6. concatenate the files
7. generate a table of contents based on the files and headers
8. generate a project map based on collected data
9. publish in HTML for ebook
10. collect $$$

As the project progresses I will be posting updates on my evolving workflow.
