# Killing is Murder

There is a long running question of where the cutoff is from justifiable homicide and outright murder.  In the case of war it is a little bit gray. I, as a Catholic, have a guide that is fairly



Drumpf boy is on a roll:

Here is my analysis and why this is different.

In the past all the invasions were under the pretense of a country that has "forfeit sovereignty" and or invited the US to intervene.

Not only does this country, Syria, have it's own defense still, the legitimate leader has publicly asked the US to get out. Trump's got an ego tho. Americans love this stuff.

This is similar to the illegal entry into iraq in 2003 except they "sorta" pretended there were WMD's.

I'm digging back through short term history to look at reasons for invasions. I supposed "ISIS" (which is publicly known to be originating from us)

This goes along with that book 'kill chain'. The narrative has changed. Innocents are totally okay for target as long as they fit an algorithm that matches them to a bad guy.  Including women and kids. Everything is gray and gray is good. International law has no value to the US citizen.


Willfully participating in this invasion and killing people equates to murder.


I have to hand it to Putin. He has taken a ton of abuse from us and still remained fairly neutral.  I should remind that a lone Russian saved the world at the closest point we have ever been to total annihilation.

The biggest problem with the erosion of international consideration is always comes home. All the things they do overseas will be done at home. Albeit at a much smaller scale.  Saying it's okay to kill someone based on religion, race, national heritage, or ideological position is definitely going to put us on the wrong side of history.
