## Camera Overview

Finding a good camera shouldn't be too difficult given how many cameras exist now. They are literally everywhere.

## Camera Criteria

I learned right away that the cameras were pretty much all standardized. They came in a few flavors but overall they were either too small, too wide, or too expensive.  That helped me limit stuff down a lot.

* small
* not much distortion (fish eye is bad)
* resolution > 720p
* color
* USB preferable

### Preferences

* Embeddable
* Flush mounted
* White
* 1080p
* hardened housing

## Hardware Choices


#### First Find

I found this one right off by searching for "USB Camera".  It has a lot of good points that seem to match what I am looking for. I didn't need the hardware shell but I can take that off I assume.

It also came with a mini processor to send the data out. I just didn't need all that.

This picture specifically cracked me up.
