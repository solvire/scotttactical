Cleaned up the trans a little bit.  Tiny bit of cosmetics.  Taped up.  Then hit it with some nice paint.  I prefer for these to have paint. Keeps cleaning it easier.  Also I think the buyer will appreciate it.

Before:

A fun fact,  this and a few of the Chevy transmissions have a prestigious history.

  * Chevy C/K Trucks
  * Suburban (this one we have)
  * Hummer H1/H2
  * Rolls Royce
  * Bentley
  * Jaguar

This is one of my favorite transmissions.  It began its life way back in 1991 and is still running strong on many high performance and heavy use vehicles.  The client base and the history should speak for its capabilities. I'm not sure if you can see it but the Willow Run bar code is still on it from its production in Michigan.  It is a little washed out.

Below are the gear ratios

It doesn't have a very low first gear because it is an auto but we have taken care of that being any kind of issue in an off road situation by removing the np205 link in the driveline and adding in an atlas2 in our plans.  We have not picked the final ratio, but that will be done in a day or so.  Its capacity for 440 ft of torque will keep us within specifications of the LS2 output. It came behind the LS2 already so we feel confident of the original engineers' decisions.
