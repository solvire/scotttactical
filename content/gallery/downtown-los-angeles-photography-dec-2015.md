## Cloudy Photography in Downtown Los Angeles

Finally a nice cool cloudy day downtown on December 22nd. Right before Christmas. It was hard to carry my motorcycle helmet and my camera. I need to figure out how to mount my helmet somewhere else while I am tooling around.

I only got a few minutes to snap but I liked these.

The US bank obscured by the clouds was a nice touch. I have to go back on a weekend and shoot more. Maybe really early before cars get all over the place.
