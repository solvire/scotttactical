# Yosemite Valley - Panorama  

With a subject as beautiful as Yosemite Valley; A photographer can be pretty unskilled and under-funded and still take an amazing picture.

## Location

The original set was taken from the overlook at the tunnel. It faces [El Capitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan) and [Cathedral Peak](http://www.summitpost.org/cathedral-peak/150524).

# Constructing a Panorama

From that vantage point listed above I staged the camera on the tripod and took several portraits as close to combined as possible.

## Panorama Stitching

I stitched everything together with [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) which actually did very well. I will do another post just for that a little later.
