Companies, searching to achieve the very best performance in the cloud, are putting a greater value on lowering the physical distance between their servers and their respective cloud providers. [Colocation data centers](http://www.equinix.com/services/data-centers-colocation/), where their machines share space, emerged as a key point in [enterprise cloud strategy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bradpeters/2013/05/21/the-worst-and-best-enterprise-cloud-strategies/#367cddf32dd8).

For CIOs, a significant advantage of colocation would be that the closeness to cloud providers makes connections faster.

The setup is becoming more and more essential as companies move a part of their IT infrastructure towards the cloud, but nonetheless need fast connections for their corporate data centers in so-known as hybrid cloud plans. 'You can observe colocation like a mid-point between your traditional type of businesses running their very own data centers and moving fully towards the public cloud,' stated [John Dinsdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndinsdale), chief analyst and controlling director of Synergy Research Group.
