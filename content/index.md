More than simply vehicle restoration, our goal with every vehicle is to ask what the engineers of yesterday would do with today&#8217;s technology.  Starting from the drivers seat and rotating outward we attempt to build a driving experience that facilitates a safer ride while still adhering to various levels of originality.  Some element are easily improved on and our time spent in research and development will help us deliver a solid and reliable vehicle.

In the world of utility versus aesthetics, we can blur the line.  Both hemispheres of the ST brain are working here.

Form must follow function.   Vehicles should be be well engineered and the beauty of true function will come through into the design.  Once function has been met then the creative eye of the designer can take hold of the state of the vehicle and move it into the realm of art.   We do not believe that it is simply enough to deliver a car as it is, but to provide a slight artistic upgrade.  Over time the various components of these vehicles will go through our design process and get added into our inventory.

We work with various artists, fabricators and designers in our field.  The mission for each vehicle is simple. Provide the utility that modern vehicles can in as much as this package can facilitate and then go one step more.

Our name will be on our vehicles so we intend them to represent the talent and depth of our team.  It is our vision to have our names be a legacy.
