      <description>Deploying Hugo the Golang CMS on DigitalOcean Creating a Droplet I am a bit partial to CentOS. The lastest version as of this writing is CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core).

      <description>Hugo: A Replacement for Wordpress TL;DR  I researched go Found Hugo Setup a test Migrated my Wordpress instance Launched DigitalOcean Droplet Deployed  Total time: 6 hours

Wordpress is hungry What was annoying about the case was that they would randomly carsh!</description>
