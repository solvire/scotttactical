&lt;h1 id=&#34;django-and-ecommerce:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Django And eCommerce&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tl-dr:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Python and want to use it for eCommerce, so I went through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/ecommerce/&#34;&gt;well known products&lt;/a&gt; and settled on Oscar as my demo. It took a while to set up, but was pretty full featured. Python and Django still have to compete with short busses like wordpress and dump trucks like Magento, but I think these tools are ready for me to start pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;preface:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say this took me almost 2 days to get through and evaluate, which I&amp;rsquo;m used to having a demo site up in minutes. After having gone through, I think this could be launched in half an hour.  Below are my notes of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;backstory:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by a business partner to see if we could kick off a project to distribute some substances that newly became legal here in CA. I thought I could spin up an ecommerce app in a couple hours and be taking payments in a week. I wanted to see how fast I could do this with Django. Most my previous eCommerce deployments (many) were in PHP and many of them were in &lt;a href=&#34;https://magento.com&#34;&gt;magento&lt;/a&gt;. Had a few in ASP, Perl, (Websphere) Java. I&amp;rsquo;m over that pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online retail - E-commerce - as an industry, is very mature. It requires a TON of flexibility and features to compete. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;pre-setup:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Pre-setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will append this by saying a few things were already installed like PostgreSQL and Python VirtualenvWrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple details about my stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local development: Mac OS X El Cap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitbucket (it&amp;rsquo;s free for private accounts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python VirtualenvWrapper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django 1.10.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL 9.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django-Oscar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;local-setup:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Local Setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setup-postgresql:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Setup PostgreSQL&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have installed PostgreSQL locally already. Please see the documentation for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PostgreSQL 9.5.3 on x86_64-apple-darwin15.4.0, compiled by Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31), 64-bit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a database for yourself. You will probably be hitting this locally with socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;createdb [project_slug]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-environment-python:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Virtual Environment - Python&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not on P3. Leave me alone, gosh. There is always some library that causes me pain. I make it future-proof as much as possible though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkvirtualenv yourapp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CD into a directory beneath your source location. I always do /project/source/*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-cookiecutter-django:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Install cookiecutter-django&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django&#34;&gt;cookiecutter&lt;/a&gt; before so I stick with what I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the new files to the remote repository and push it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
git add .
git commit -m &amp;quot;first commit&amp;quot;
git remote add origin yourname@bitbucket.com:yourapp/yourapp.git
git push -u origin master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;django-setup:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Django Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try out Django Oscar. I figure it is the most popular. And also hoping it isn&amp;rsquo;t the most bloated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add oscar to the bottom of the requirements file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim requirements/base.txt
-e git+https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar.git@master#egg=django-oscar
django-compressor==2.1
pycountry==17.1.8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with oscar and Django 1.10 so pull the latest from master. I also had to modify the source to get the middleware to work as well. Small enough problems that I didn&amp;rsquo;t totally abandon the project at this point. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/issues/2205&#34;&gt;https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/issues/2205&lt;/a&gt; I entered a code fix + pull request so hopefully it is fixed. There was also a problem with the pycountry change as listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now pip install everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install -r requirements/local.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should bring in everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the environment template file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp env.example config/settings/.env
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the manage command to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./manage.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;set-up-oscar:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Set Up Oscar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in &lt;code&gt;yourapp/config/settings/common.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &amp;lsquo;oscar&amp;rsquo; to the third party installed applications in the settings file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://django-oscar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internals/getting_started.html#django-settings&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; update the settings for the templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Import all the oscar items

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        },
    },
]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows the users to log in with email as well as username, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I will use that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &#39;oscar.apps.customer.auth_backends.EmailBackend&#39;,

    &#39;allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend&#39;,
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom set the haystack settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {
    &#39;default&#39;: {
        &#39;ENGINE&#39;: &#39;haystack.backends.simple_backend.SimpleEngine&#39;,
    },
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-the-urls:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Set the URLs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my url file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;...
from oscar.app import application

urlpatterns = [
    # url(r&#39;^$&#39;, TemplateView.as_view(template_name=&#39;pages/home.html&#39;), name=&#39;home&#39;),
    url(r&#39;^about/$&#39;, TemplateView.as_view(template_name=&#39;pages/about.html&#39;), name=&#39;about&#39;),

    # Django Admin, use {% url &#39;admin:index&#39; %}
    url(settings.ADMIN_URL, admin.site.urls),

    # User management
    url(r&#39;^users/&#39;, include(&#39;yourapp.users.urls&#39;, namespace=&#39;users&#39;)),
    url(r&#39;^accounts/&#39;, include(&#39;allauth.urls&#39;)),

    # Your stuff: custom urls includes go here
    url(r&#39;^i18n/&#39;, include(&#39;django.conf.urls.i18n&#39;)),
    url(r&#39;&#39;, include(application.urls)),

] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

if settings.DEBUG:
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-schema:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Build Schema&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the database is created and you set up everything properly you should be able to build the DB schema now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./manage.py migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-local:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Start Local&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kick off the local server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./manage.py runserver_plus
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything works properly you should be able to go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:8000/&#34;&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/a&gt; and see your new project running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;store-setup:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Store Setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite enough for me so I needed to add some products into the application really quickly to see the catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-shipping-countries:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Install Shipping Countries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pycountry should have been installed already, and it was suggested to load all the countries in the oscar documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./manage.py oscar_populate_countries --no-shipping
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threw an attribute error. At this point I am thinking this application may be a bit fragile. There is a pull request for it so I just manually made the change and it worked. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/pull/2182&#34;&gt;https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/pull/2182&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m annoyed at pycountry for a menial change like that. Or provide a better SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-templates-are:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Where Templates Are?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that the templates were not seen even though they were in the path. I just copied them from the oscar sandbox example so that I had more to go off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/src/oscar/templates/oscar/*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also copied over all the static content into the media directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/src/oscar/static/oscar/img &amp;gt; yourapp/static
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dashboard:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you created a superuser account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login and travel to the dashboard: &lt;a href=&#34;http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/&#34;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;product-setup:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Product Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have a category and a shipper. That is easy enough to set up. I added a couple products and viewed them on the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/oscar1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Product Page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/oscar2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dashboard&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-structure:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Code Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looked fine to me. I was able to find my way around very easily compared to the likes of Magento, IBM, SAP. Thank goodness. That is stuff of nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loaders:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Loaders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework is important to me. I like to see proper recognizable patterns. There were red flags with the model class &amp;ldquo;loader&amp;rdquo; paradigm when I expected to see Django objects. I think that is unnecessary with a framework that has good bootstrapping functionality such as Django. Maybe someone can explain where my thinking is in error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-rest-for-me:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;No REST for me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed with how hard it was to find information about oscar and an integration with a REST layer. Most sites MUST support mobile. And probably should support mobile FIRST. The old days of a monolithic website stack are kinda over. Especially with javascript running rampage over the facades of the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar-api&#34;&gt;django oscar api&lt;/a&gt; - It needs more thorough documentation, and matrix of supported features would be nice. Overall it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;performance:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application felt kinda slow. Maybe it can be optimized, but for a starter, I felt like it should be more responsive. The feel of other apps was a little better. With ecommerce the most important thing is checkout flow followed by performance and product data.  Don&amp;rsquo;t skimp on ANY of those things.  Let the design languish if you have budget for a performance hacker. I&amp;rsquo;ve launched large ecommerce sites and this is what killed most of them once traffic rolled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;will-it-stay:b4021289b9cd78d0572b4b30b6bfd1a4&#34;&gt;Will it Stay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have to look through &lt;a href=&#34;http://getsaleor.com/&#34;&gt;Saleor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mezzanine.jupo.org/&#34;&gt;Cartrige on Mezzanine&lt;/a&gt; which were very appealing. I also wanted to have a hand at setting up an ecommerce app in Go, but the lack of templating and abstraction that python is good at was a knock down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-it-needs-help-my-letter:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Why It Needs Help - My Letter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an open letter to the Covered California website designer, administrators, bureaucrats and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;website-design-and-usability:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Website Design and Usability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several things listed below. Things I find to be of poor design or just plain broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-don-t-got-mail:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Got Mail!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Secure Mailbox (2)&amp;rdquo; even though nothing was in my mail box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It randomly logged me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-on-click-me-if-ya-can:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;GO&amp;rsquo;ON CLICK ME IF YA CAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am low on time for open enrollment and it gave me a &amp;ldquo;Pay Now&amp;rdquo; button in order to do it faster, but the button was broken. It would pop up and then if I tried to pay it would throw a JavaScript error in my console and close out. Now I can&amp;rsquo;t pay. It&amp;rsquo;s weird when people don&amp;rsquo;t want my money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page refreshing on every submission of information is mind numbing. Just cache it. Or make the template more clean. Or make it more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-your-accounts-all-belong-to-us:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;All your accounts all belong to us!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Account section has almost nothing about what plans I selected. I am glad I was taking screenshots along the way. How do you guys even know what I selected. Isn&amp;rsquo;t there a table with a key that can simply show what my plans look like? How do I get back to that information? It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this hard. Do you even care about me getting to my coverage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You sent me zero email notifications based on what I was signing up for. And I specifically put that email was my preferred contact method. Instead you handed it off to someone else and washed your hands. They will be mailing me things. I don&amp;rsquo;t go to my mailbox every day. It&amp;rsquo;s a drive. I&amp;rsquo;m not some home loafer who waits by his mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;penrose-navigation:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Penrose Navigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layout of the pages is all wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s got too much nonsense on it. Right hand home page &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; navigation is hard to see and nonintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have an informational video on the bottom left barely under the fold. Why? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t there be an info section or a knowledge base. Just use another website for an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-are-up-100-of-the-time-50-of-the-day:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;We are up 100% of the time 50% of the day!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on reliability. The site will be down or throwing errors half the time I got through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me 5 tries to actually get through this whole process.  It was painful. No commercial company would survive this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-not-home:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;We Not Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do you make me fill in 8!!! lines of information to start a live chat. Seriously. If I am logged in just open the chat window and start talking. Is this a game? Don&amp;rsquo;t make me mask my phone number with special characters&amp;hellip; Especially if you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to just be integers.  (###) ###-####  no! I don&amp;rsquo;t like that format. I use dots because i&amp;rsquo;m not older than 50 and know how to use a 10key. What if I was doing this on a mobile device. Have you even watched Office Space? Do you want someone to red stapler your website?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is &amp;ldquo;report a change&amp;rdquo; hovering in some dead zone where a lady and a baby are. Is that lady and baby supposed to make me think men don&amp;rsquo;t apply or that I should be taking out more coverage because there are family health issues at stake here. Report a change should show up when you log in. Just get people to log in and then present the info in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;navigation-as-path-not-choices:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Navigation as Path not Choices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordering of your navigation is not industry best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the right&amp;hellip; those options? Some are grayed out. You aren&amp;rsquo;t looking at this the right way. It is highly confusing. Are they headers or do they just disappear? If they are disabled why? Why can&amp;rsquo;t I discontinue any time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to control state on your navigation. For instance: if i am signed up and you dont&amp;rsquo; want to show &amp;ldquo;select a plan&amp;rdquo; and instead make &amp;ldquo;change plan&amp;rdquo; the path then you dont&amp;rsquo; leave &amp;ldquo;select a plan&amp;rdquo; still there and just gray it out. Why? If it&amp;rsquo;s not available then remove it. It&amp;rsquo;s like when you are editing something you don&amp;rsquo;t have two buttons for create and save next to each other and just gray out  create. You remove it. It&amp;rsquo;s not relevant or part of the user state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loco-help:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Loco Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW I tried the &amp;ldquo;Find Local Help&amp;rdquo; button and all the people I called on that suggested list said they don&amp;rsquo;t help with Medical or Covered CA. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what your intention is there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Español ▼&amp;rdquo; dropdown should actually be a drop down. I went to click on espanol and it just changed the language instead of actually giving me the drop down. You are doing double duty on that field and it&amp;rsquo;s misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mobiles-need-not-apply:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Mobiles Need Not Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This website is NOT mobile friendly.  Big sin buddies. Are none of your constituents under 30?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is pretty much all I picked up today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion:6fc9dbe0e4c93911a33da0d91571ac2c&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop hiring crony consultants and design firms. Give respectable shops a chance to do it right. You might actually save some money and have some customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just my .02&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=st=&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-waves-of-technology-professional:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;The Waves of Technology Professional&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to consider 2001 the tail edge of the Internet bubble.  It was a brutal time to be in a computer science field. There weren&amp;rsquo;t many jobs. The jobs that were being squatted on were jealously guarded. I needed the one thing that nobody would provide. Experience. So instead I grinded projects and studied unceasingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001 I had to take a job as an &amp;ldquo;integration specialist&amp;rdquo;.  That is basically a programmer job with a crappy title, so they didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay me much. I was making $12.50/hr, and it was business casual dress code.  Meaning I worked for barely enough to pay my bills, but I had to wear a tie to work. This Internet revolution was starting to look like a failed promise. I should have realized then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this writing is not to sound weepy or nostalgic. It is to point out the direction of this trade and to try to illuminate the evil of being efficient only for the sake of being efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-1st-technology-wave:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;The 1st Technology Wave&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father is a software engineer approaching retirement. He programmed midrange and mainframes, so I was exposed to this stuff my whole life. Ironically I loathed computers and vowed to go into the military where money and schooling wouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the pre-boom days, there were a lot of people coming up with ways to make things happen.  People were building web servers and writing routines to return data in formats that web browsers could read. My roommate in the Army was a very rare computer science major and helped me start building Linux boxes in my bedroom in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first technologists in this field were doing their best to get computer hardware to do new things. A narrow field of technology started to form around TCP/IP and HTTP. We were creating a boom culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1st-wave-engineers:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;1st Wave Engineers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guys working on internet technologies before 1995 were completely different than the ones nowadays. These were engineers in the old sense. They wore suits to the office. They had a 9-6 job usually.  They were seen in a similar manner as industrial engineers, electrical engineers, chemists, or mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys seemed to be relatively conservative with their approach. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to go on and sorta made things work.  There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much focus on design or art at all. It was purely pragmatic.  Bits in and bits out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a problem today. You don&amp;rsquo;t have Google. You have a 1,000-page document on your operating system. Now figure out how to get your server to print to a dot matrix printer over serial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;dotcom-boom:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;DotCom Boom&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people I initially started working with were a mix of self-taught programmers and people who were left over from the big machine era. The field was getting flooded with engineering speculators. The idea of moving to California and striking it rich with technology was too hard to resist so I foolishly was caught up into the surge. I packed up and moved to Simi Valley with a former military buddy of mine as we set out to gain our fortunes.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;stepping-over-opportunities:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Stepping Over Opportunities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was offered a few opportunities that were less than ethical. Some porn, some spam, some malware. I turned them all down, because I was here to help change the world for the better. I wanted to work with a big organization that did great things. That never manifested and I realized that there isn&amp;rsquo;t any great company helping the world. They all have an uber-powerful dark side that powers their facade.  The CMO is the bishop of this church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-clickpocalypse:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;The Clickpocalypse&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2005 I found myself working for a company that was running an offer path. Basically one of those sites where you enter your email and get a free iPod. It made an obscene amount of money. It was super dirty too.  Myself and a couple other engineers stood up a site in 3 months and starting bringing on hundreds of thousands of new users a day.  It was pouring in money. There were all sorts of Italian sports cars in the parking lot.  People were partying hard.  Except the nerds. We were locked into the office while they flew all over the world having fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest target was middle and later aged people who were at home with nothing better to do. Majority women. I think 60% was a number I saw a lot.  It exploited a demographic incredibly well.  From time to time I thought that there couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be this many suckers out there.  Could there be an unlimited supply? Apparently so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran on cheap commodity hardware and buily our own rack in a data center. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone helping us out. The coders were as likely to be going down and compiling at the data center as anyone. We handled as much traffic back then as any company I have worked at since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spread our data out wide. We were doing things that didn&amp;rsquo;t have names yet. We were buffering with local disks and clustering on shared storage. We were aggregating streams of log files. It was quite the learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;engineering-conservatism:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Engineering Conservatism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in this period, there was still a mentality of being conservative with our decisions.  The cutting edge was generally considered suicide.  Not that it was unstable, but that you are betting your reputation and career on that gamble.  If your very basic business problem could be solved with mature technologies then that is what you used.  These days failure is grounds for a promotion and telling your boss you plan to do something cool is actually as good as doing what the business needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used a kernel from BSD or RedHat that had been vetted in the field for multiple years.  We stripped layers of unknown from the presentation languages. Most of the code was in Perl and PHP and we compiled those ourselves.  It was incredibly lightweight. Because we built the OS stack, we were able to fine-tune to squeeze everything out of the boxes.  People were coding in production and deploying nonstop. It was a flying chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a stack of 7-8 web servers with between &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2GB of RAM, we were able to handle more traffic than many Grande sized deployments on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;gluten-free-buzzwords:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Gluten Free Buzzwords&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t start getting swept up into the buzzword mania until after 2010. It began to seem that if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using some new technology thing that I was irrelevant. I started consuming new technologies like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buzzword technology replaced computer science discipline. Before 2010 I spent time learning basics of architecture and design patterns. After 2010 I spent all my time plugging in some nebulous new appliance into my bloated and overweight stack.  Before 2010 I was learning how memory allocation and database calculations work. After 2010 I was trying to figure out how to grow my instances inside the AWS monolith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed as though every software geek was intoxicated with the pace of change.  Their value was in the number of technologies they touched. This silicon zealotry was almost like the mob movements seen in nationalism or tribalism.  Giant herds of people storming the gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-3rd-wave:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;The 3rd Wave&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aws-github-winning:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;AWS:GITHUB Winning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS won. They removed the cost of entry for people to get a server up and going and allowed for a new breed of engineers to enter. One of the biggest costs to getting large sites up and hosted was learning how to build and deploy hardware and networking, and then fine tune it. Amazon capitalized on this need for speed. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t about getting a stable product to market faster: it was the sales pitch of being able to use a bunch of buzzwords and then show a prototype to investors very quickly. Amazon knew that this is how it would go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;constant-deployment:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Constant Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an especially important mindset of 3rd wavers: they have a very low sociopolitical self-worth. What I mean by this is there is a massive race to the floor when it comes to their control over what they deliver to business and stakeholders.  They have embraced the &amp;ldquo;fail fast&amp;rdquo; mentality and reduced the quality of their trade.   The deployment lifecycle might be the most valuable tool in maintaining power at the engineering and systems level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take two scenarios. One person is an engineer for an avionics company. The other for a social media company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These avionics engineers probably work fewer hours and have better perks. They are probably not bullied by sales and product management and also have insight into how the company grows.  They are very concerned about quality control principles and advanced engineering disciplines. Their average age is 48 and are mixed with Baby Boomers, X&amp;rsquo;ers and a few Millennials.  They  support multi-billion dollar contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs working on the social media product were probably contracted from BFE for $25/hr and will be dumped as soon as the project is over. They work insane hours and are constantly berated by their management, sales and teammates. Their average age is 28 and are part of the Millennial caste. So, basically every place I have worked since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business would listen to us if we worked together. There is plenty of money there for us to carve out a stable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bugpocalypse:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Bugpocalypse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this rapid progress good? I would say software is no more stable than it was before. Statistics do not allude to fewer bugs. In fact, in the near future, we could be looking at a major problem with zero-day vulnerabilities, IoT, the Java monoculture, and the flood of inferior engineering skills in the last 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet tech is following a similar &amp;ldquo;population explosion&amp;rdquo; path that exists in biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;technofacist:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Technofacist&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet applications industry seems to be taking the exact same route that terrestrial radio and cable television took. They had huge explosion of small companies and then an all-consuming consolidation into a few major players followed by governmental and special interest group integration. My assumption is that it will be 3 for us: Google, Facebook, Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 horsemen are poised to dominate everything online.  You might think this is totally fine with the whole economy of scale nonsense, but you might also want to look at history.  Powerful systems usually will move fast to crush competition and control their constituents.  This consolidation of power is facilitated by the unquestioning loyalty to the system.  Because the system gives us one-click purchases and the ability to see our friends&amp;rsquo; cat habits any time of the day we are okay with letting them brand us and feed us garbage. They are turning the Internet into Walmart and Costco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generation of engineers have very limited understanding of the things that it takes to keep all this equipment going. Within a few years, there will be very few people left that understand the entire stack.  The systems administrators are the first to sell off their souls to Amazon which is tantamount to sawing off the tree branch you are standing on. Once Amazon provides enough buttons, then all we need to do is move the jobs overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than once I have heard a DevOps engineer tell management that their goal is to code away their job.  Please, tech people! Stop sucking at politics and curb your enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon it will be powered mostly by offshore companies, weakly skilled coders stabbing at each other over scraps and the very few good engineers working inside giant monolithic companies, mired under lack of progress and nonstop political infighting. Maybe I should just focus on getting a job at one of those places, or go back and get an MBA and push around technies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion:5c2ece4c22166c8b10604511b8c82a7b&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is probably too late to reverse the trend. It is disappointing to see the greatest communication medium ever developed, turned over to a handful of massive corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make Internet Grate Again&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>HowTo Bind Multiple Terminals MacOS-X</title>
          <link>http://scotttactical.com/post/howto-bind-multiple-terminals-macos-x/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2016 19:09:21 PST</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Tactical</author>
          <guid>http://scotttactical.com/post/howto-bind-multiple-terminals-macos-x/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;binding-multiple-terminals:763c5c7c581e44ba4ac71791c31d5d75&#34;&gt;Binding Multiple Terminals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am running on multiple servers all the time. And with DTAC doing testing of big data I obviously need to play with many servers at once. I used to do a lot of work on linux and loved the broadcast ability of the terminals. So when I moved onto mac I expected more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a few other terminal apps. Particularly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-one-page.html&#34;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; that has some nice broadcasting. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t like having to deal with the tabs and keystrokes. I kinda liked having multiple windows and the ease of launching with csshX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;csshx-installation:763c5c7c581e44ba4ac71791c31d5d75&#34;&gt;csshX Installation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;csshX - Cluster SSH tool using MacOS-X Terminal.app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;brew install csshx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you have a working copy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;csshx &amp;ndash;help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;configure-csshx:763c5c7c581e44ba4ac71791c31d5d75&#34;&gt;Configure csshX&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a config file. I chose to set up an rc file in my home directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;touch ~/.csshrc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;logging-in-with-ssh-keys:763c5c7c581e44ba4ac71791c31d5d75&#34;&gt;Logging In With SSH Keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are going to need this. Pretty much all cloud servers require keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;csshx &amp;ndash;login ubuntu &amp;ndash;ssh_args &amp;ldquo;-i .ssh/your_private_key&amp;rdquo; host1 host2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should get you pretty far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;writing-in-markdown:f66853f3398525872cad9091a5df51e1&#34;&gt;Writing in Markdown&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t used &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; to write in a rich(er) text format, then you are missing out. I pretty much write all my technical documentation in Markdown. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome and I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it took me so long to find it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start using it until around 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-markdown:f66853f3398525872cad9091a5df51e1&#34;&gt;What is Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown was created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&#34;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Gruber created the &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Markdown language&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people &amp;ldquo;to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that even mean? Well it just means it is plain text that has a few symbols to make it mean something more. Once you write a little of it then it&amp;rsquo;s much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure how DaringFireball made any money, but I guess once you get traffic it&amp;rsquo;s all gravy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-objectives:f66853f3398525872cad9091a5df51e1&#34;&gt;The Objectives&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-management:f66853f3398525872cad9091a5df51e1&#34;&gt;Time Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write on various applications and in various places. I am always just jotting stuff down in Evernote, voice notes on my phone, sketching on my Post-it pad, etc.  I&amp;rsquo;m totally distributed. I think everywhere so I might as well be able to write everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so few minutes of available time in my day that I want to make use of them. If I tallied up all my available time in a day and aggregated it I would have easily written a few novels by now. But that is another topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deficiency-analysis:f66853f3398525872cad9091a5df51e1&#34;&gt;Deficiency Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to identify all the areas that were keeping me from writing.  The biggest was obviously motivation and getting back in the flow. I fail the biggest recommendation I have read: write every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem was my editor sucked. I was using OpenOfficeArg. Totally a busted app now. Sorry guys. Time to ditch you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third problem was that my project was getting too ambitious and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep all the links to the ideas. Part of that reason was the gaps in writing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;workflow:f66853f3398525872cad9091a5df51e1&#34;&gt;Workflow&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my proposed workflow. It will be adjusted over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break every chapter apart into it&amp;rsquo;s own file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a new chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide headers with tags and various elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a script fill the headers with any markdown notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the headers to link the files together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concatenate the files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate a table of contents based on the files and headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate a project map based on collected data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish in HTML for ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collect $$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the project progresses I will be posting updates on my evolving workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Why We Quit OpenStack: or How I Lost 2 Months of My Life</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is a massive complicated ecosystem. It is only going to survive by the vendors that support it and probably not what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;backstory:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by saying that given the proper talent pool, financial resources, and time; OpenStack probably isn&amp;rsquo;t bad for some people. For most institutions it is just &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will probably write another article that outlines all the questions that I should have asked before starting this. My assumptions were not all quite valid, but I did have a sneaking suspicion given a couple very relevant experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several people asked me about a way to do big(ish) data at an affordable price. I enjoy owning hardware and infrastructure and from a business perspective that is a fairly decent endeavor in terms of static equity. I was bored with coding. The two of those items intersected and I decided to take on the task of bringing in some data clients and see if I could beat the services of other competitors and give them a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: This site is currently running on our openstack deployment in &lt;a href=&#34;http://dtac.io&#34;&gt;DTAC&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; private cloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/full_openstack.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Full OpenStack&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;red-flags:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Red Flags&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there are &lt;em&gt;clouds&lt;/em&gt; of smoke, there is probably fire. - An Indian Truism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-took-forever:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;It Took Forever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I witnessed an ambitious project slide face-first into the blue and white parking stall of the private cloud mall. Then later it was used as leverage to out every participant. I mostly attributed the breakdown to lack of time resources, OS talent and political infighting.  &lt;em&gt;nerds (heart) aws&lt;/em&gt; but more on that elsewhere.  Ignoring those huge red flags I figured my sysadmin abilities would be able to figure things out and surpass them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: I got sysadmin skills and no politics. I&amp;rsquo;ve never failed to raise a datacenter infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;openstack-hate-speech:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;OpenStack Hate Speech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of hating over OpenStack. More specifically there was a lot of negative commentary about Nova, Neutron and Cinder. Basically the heart of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: I kinda need those bells and whistles so it&amp;rsquo;s worth dealing with monolithic bloat because that&amp;rsquo;s my only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nerds-heart-aws:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Nerds (heart) AWS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is blood in the streets, buy land. - Contrarian Invetors&amp;rsquo; Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for OpenStack talent was like looking for unbiased political commentary on twitter. Just ain&amp;rsquo;t there.  Techs not only didn&amp;rsquo;t know it well, but most applicants that had it on their resumes didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deploy it. Out of 50 techs I talked with about private cloud work, 49 said they could help me set up with Amazon AW$.  It is entirely confusing to ask someone to help you with your private cloud and they offer to help what is essentially a competing public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side note: Most tech professionals also said they were getting a &amp;ldquo;great deal&amp;rdquo; at Amazon. No financial officer I talked to shared this sentiment. I&amp;rsquo;m sure business math was never part of comp-sci. Food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: Well most nerds have near-0 business strategy. Also this indicates there is a massive gap in talent so I&amp;rsquo;d like to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;babylon-fortuna-ergo-enterprise-ready:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Babylon Fortuna ergo Enterprise-Ready&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase is huge. And kinda old at this point. In internet years it&amp;rsquo;s about 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: It is mature enough to use. I should be ashamed of myself. I deployed IBM Websphere and should have known better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-is-complicated:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;It is Complicated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/fb_complicated.png&#34; alt=&#34;It&#39;s Complicated&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the diagram. Seriously Siri WHERE IS MY CAR!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://docs.openstack.org/icehouse/training-guides/content/figures/5/a/figures/openstack-arch-havana-logical-v1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;OpenStack&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW this image is taken from the OpenStack &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: Well, shit. Guess I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with worse. I hope there isn&amp;rsquo;t magic happening. I&amp;rsquo;ll trust the Fuel installers. Oh God Fuel! don&amp;rsquo;t fail me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-is-fragile:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;It Is Fragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to the previous diagram. With so many moving parts and given the lack of talent capable of managing it there is a serious level of risk in trusting a critical production environment on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: Keep my public cloud fail overs built and ready to deploy. I&amp;rsquo;m a cheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-is-vendor-driven:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;It Is Vendor Driven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda knew that the growth of OpenStack was tainted by vendor intrigue. I have run into this spending a considerable amount of time working with OAuth 2.0 when the &amp;ldquo;framework&amp;rdquo; was going through proposals and the lead writers were splitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cite: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/summit-videos/presentation/openstack-is-doomed-and-it-is-your-fault&#34;&gt;OpenStack is Doomed - Andy (termie) Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response: Ick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-final-decision:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;The Final Decision&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it might work for a team like RackSpace, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it fits what we need. The cost benefit of having a few drivers and some prebuilt scripts to managing images wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough to justify the cost and risk of having a system that is so fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk and the knowns of unknowns inside the massive spaghetti of scope creep was enough that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to jump in and fix something within less than a day. Pretty much every code fix I had to make took more than a day. More of 3-5 days to figure out each bug. That was the last straw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opennebula:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;OpenNebula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried other stacks and I launched a multiple node infrastructure with OpenNebula. It was refreshingly vertical and self-contained. But still felt like it wanted to follow the hypervisor slipstream of OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blah-stack:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Blah-Stack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of other options but I was burned out at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-plans:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus internally is more on bare-metal and OS containers. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion:b85c7312ab9bb2e49c842e2b5c6f0ec6&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no free ride. (Development is an Expect 2 Work Employment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swiss army knives suck for self-defense and bayonets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t expect to launch a cloud out of the box that will fit your business needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe the marketing - baaah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community first, politics last&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <title>Interview Strategies: A Technology Hiring Manager Who Wins</title>
          <link>http://scotttactical.com/interview-strategies-a-technology-hiring-manager/</link>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I stacked pennies from the ground to the top of the Empire State Bldg, would they all fit into this room?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly dear sir, you do not have that many pennies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly if you cash it in for large bills then they all fit in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a question like this that would make me decide alternatively in my career choice. However I see tech managers searching for really “smart” interview questions and white board problems in an attempt to stump the prospective employee. Is the work you do not interesting enough that you are unable to ask a question related to the job? I have also found that blowing these tests off had zero effect in my employability. If they want you they already want you. Kinda like approaching attractive women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also seen interviews &lt;strong&gt;last for days&lt;/strong&gt;. A friend asked if I wanted to work with him at a three-letter company, but recalling his four day interview I cordially passed. It is like pledging into a frat, I suppose. I can throw a couple keggers and streak to show my commitment to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My background diverges from most so let me try to bridge the gap with a little explanation. My land feet were broken in courtesy of the US Army. Before you dismiss anything, let me assure you this business is bigger than yours. It is a highly evolved consumption machine, and they do human resources with the finesse of a high density feed chute operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not much of an interview process normally. There is a selection process where the candidates may project their willingness to participate by enduring copious amounts of physical and emotional pain while maintaining a (faux) positive attitude about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the new job a ranking non-commissioned officer (sergeant) will walk up and assess how a soldier will perform, who they should bunk with, what weapon platform they are going to carry and if they can pull a girlfriend or not. Yes this happens instantly. Sometimes they get a bad apple, but it is not about refusing candidates since that is not their privilege. It is about getting the apples into the right baskets. Of course some NCOs may target people based on certain characteristics: height, weight, glasses, smug look or whatever caught their attention, but it normally only takes an initial look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://img.scotttactical.com/images/legacy/2015/10/napoleon-bonaparte.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;napoleon bonaparte&#34; width=&#34;797&#34; height=&#34;412&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-288&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no bad soldiers, only bad officers. - Napoleon Bonaparte, General and Emperor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is very different about the military and private business however and I think this is key. The military needs leaders whereas business grooms managers. Leaders are responsible for their subordinates. This is a very powerful teaching tool you will not forget. It is the leaders&amp;rsquo; fault not theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a stellar hiring record. There was only a couple people that did not fit in or were not able to produce. This is over 8 years of being in a position where I was primary interviewer or had a say in who came onto the team. I can qualify this measure by saying there are only 2 people I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hire again to include hiring for my personal business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My normal interview will last less than 15 minutes. That&amp;rsquo;s all I need. Anything else is fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my discovery list and the things I need to know before I get to the “smart guy” or “personality” stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do they like to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is coding a hobby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a public code repository, what does it look like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they have family. (I know HR keeps telling me not to, but I can figure this out)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far is the commute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decoding-requirements-reading-a-resume:0180bc8b1de3d2a16a176d2974fd5842&#34;&gt;Decoding Requirements: Reading a Resume&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of those items I can get before hand. I will scan down the resume and see what they have done. Normally I do not go past the skills list though. If I do I just look across a few major keywords in their list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I try to check out there code. Hopefully they can provide something. If they have a public repository great. If they contributed to a project even better. If they do not code on the side it is a big red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to see what technology they use. If it is only bleeding edge I will usually pass. That shows hubris and are probably willing to use the office as a lab. If they do not have anything current they might be slow to adopt so I make some notes to ask them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern&#34;&gt;design patterns&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that if someone cares about their career at all they know this stuff. If they do not know what design patterns are I pass, but I give them a couple study guides. At least know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The candidate can provide a list of stacks they are comfortable working with. They will most likely list them in order of confidence so I just keep note of that. Then I ask what versions they work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should describe their development environment. If they use mac or linux they get a much better score in my head. Wat? Windows? Fine, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School is not important. My best guys were either not in languages I wanted, not comp-sci or coming from completely different areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good coders are not good at selling themselves. They shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to. I do not like any hype and it is a big red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to check social media. If they can not keep their laundry tidy we probably will not work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;every-body-says-it-nonverbal-cues:0180bc8b1de3d2a16a176d2974fd5842&#34;&gt;Every Body Says It: Nonverbal Cues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the conversation I get a sense for their comfort based on how they approach the interview. If they are sitting in a respectful but confident posture either they are really good at faking it or they are solid in the skills they are projecting. Clothes do not matter. We are not hired on our costume skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of cold reading is outside the scope of this document, but I highly suggest studying topics related to body language and nonverbal communication. The exact percentage is debatable but most of our communication is nonverbal. At least have a phone conversation before proceeding. This will be the most telling item concerning someone&amp;rsquo;s “cultural” fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:0180bc8b1de3d2a16a176d2974fd5842&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of those items listed there are no right or wrong answers. They simply show me what basket I can allocate someone to. My baskets are very limited sometimes so if I do not have one to fill then I just cannot invent one. That is bizdev&amp;rsquo;s job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not project an ego into the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The decision should come easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. Given the height of the Empire State Building of 1,454&amp;#8242;. It takes 16 pennies to equal an inch. If you stacked pennies to that height it would take 16 x 12 x 1454 = 279,168, or slightly less than $3k. Let&amp;rsquo;s also say you have the ability to pass those through image recognition software grafted to a Diebold change machine to find rare and valuable pennies. Take that and apply the “coupon collector&amp;rsquo;s problem” with mint counts for the top 20 rare pennies and you come come out with odds or a wild ass guess (WAG) for how that $3k might be worth significantly more for the time and liberal application of available algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart people already figured out these things.&lt;/p&gt;
