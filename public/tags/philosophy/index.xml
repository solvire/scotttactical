&lt;h1 id=&#34;preface-to-vehemenism&#34;&gt;Preface to Vehemenism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening letter to future ultra-violent men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stand at a transition. Either at the bottom of a cliff we may ascend, or at the precipice of one we will be pushed from. This &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; is addressed to men alone. Only we are the ones presented with this unique problem.  It is a problem of perspective and one that contains many recursive questions.  The answer to these questions will ultimately decide whether or not the observer was indeed a man. That question will ultimately distill to a single query: &amp;ldquo;Am I to destroy myself?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few men left, and that number is decreasing rapidly. Daily, men are swept up into situations of dramatic tone or superficial satisfaction, and thus lose track of their primary objective of continuing their growth as men. Essentially they die in place or regress back into boyhood.  It is not the goal of this philosophy to determine whether someone is in a state inside or outside of natural balance. It is not the job of philosophy to find the man and teach him. It is the man&amp;rsquo;s job to find the Truth and come to terms with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will note that what I reference is not my entire personal philosophy, but variations on it.  I am Aristotelian and admire the stoic qualities. I also find them to more appropriate recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve considered not writing under my personal identities because I still enjoy some of the benefits of this mature, albeit feminine, society.  At this point, given our political and foreign policies, it takes relatively little effort to be kicked out. It won&amp;rsquo;t be the first time. Luckily my marketing usually suffers, so it is doubtful many if any will see this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cyclical changes in society are not things any one person has control over. We are actors in the play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I immediately focus on men? If this is a cultural epoch then why not include all of Society?  Women and children are part of society, but are not being fundamentally altered. They are being amplified. Their amplification is dramatically reducing the available pool of men. In this scenario, there is a zero-sum outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason that this series will approach men first is because Vehemenism is characteristically masculine. It is the crack and whiplash at the end of Nihilism; which is characteristically feminine.  Ex: Feelings are the will and the will to power is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to how the mode of communication does shape the message, the environment in which we persist will shape us. We have less control over our environment than we believe. The goal of this series is to identify the aspects of the environment that do affect men and how it will shape us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to predict the future; however, this new philosophy is an abstract concept that I find follows nihilistic decadence as a natural recapitulation. Call it the payment on the blood debt. It may not last for long after nihilism. Feminism may win and bring on a new era. The problem with the latter is an era of feminine peace is an era without peace and &lt;strong&gt;an era without men&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also attempt to lay out modern scientific, biological and sociological ideas that are newer and contradict the classical concepts relating to the identity of self and the exercise of will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I will be able to identify the way these men might communicate on a substratum.  There is always a mode of communication that facilitates uninhibited collaboration. The same with feminist magazines or women&amp;rsquo;s book clubs. Places that were almost entirely free of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a philosophy of a post-modern post-Christian male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tribalism&#34;&gt;Tribalism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men are tribal. There is no question about this. Anyone who has a problem understanding this concept is not a man. It is our natural state. It is not a state that children, boys, and women would ever naturally coalesce into.  Boys tend to drift this direction, but it is a weak concept for them because they lack some of the requisites that each man must bring into the tribe. Those sacred ingredients are what men require, and the tribe requires to function and sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a difference in the paleo-tribalism that we might theorize early humans were practicing, and what we see today with neo-tribalism.  I am referencing the adherence to social norms which force people into fabricated tribes such as sports teams, nations, schools, political parties or ideological bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is we have very weak ideas about how humans lived before there was written history. Intelligent people have tried to theorize, but that dynamic will always be misunderstood. We simply don&amp;rsquo;t know.  Considering &lt;strong&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to live in their own skin as real men&lt;/strong&gt;, it is unlikely they understand the dynamics of prehistoric males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tribalism will hold a central fixture in this series because that is the basic power structure for a male-centric existence. A man can still be a man by himself, but it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to develop essential skills and survive. Bravo to those who can or are forced to.  To go beyond the tribe into a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;society&amp;rdquo; always suggests a sacrifice of the tribe&lt;/strong&gt; and the roles that men hold inside that social paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-pack&#34;&gt;The Pack&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership is something that has mostly vanished in modern society. Many people think they are leaders, but in actuality, they are just bosses pushing people around and wholly supported by an efficient and complicated infrastructure. I will attempt to go into what leadership is and how it relates to the outcome of the pack as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership is directly linked to the long-term survival of the tribe. There is an imprint of the leader of the pack on that pack. What makes a tribe different from a squad, company, sports team, or any other fiscal endeavor is the &lt;strong&gt;tribe is for life&lt;/strong&gt;.  A manager doesn&amp;rsquo;t expect to be involved with a group for more than a few months or years. His priority is his personal advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packs need an alpha to be a pack. At least one. Many alpha types can exist in a group, and all males should seek to live as alphas even if they are in supporting roles. Followers are just as important as leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now there is a general dearth of qualified or capable males for these roles. Most do not understand or care to learn what base virtues are required in the making of an alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-virtues&#34;&gt;The Virtues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chivalry is dead&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French taught us that at Agincourt. Arrogant nobility pretended to adventure themselves against a band of peasants and were properly pwned. Idealism is a great way to get one&amp;rsquo;s brain scooped out in front of one&amp;rsquo;s friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtues and pseudo-virtues of after Roman/medieval era did not and will not hold any gunpowder nowadays. I will try to explain why they do not and what they have been replaced with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The martial virtues are still somewhat intact and combined with tribal virtue they may not scale very well, but are the strongest group bonds and fulfill men in a way that no other system is capable of right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;violence&#34;&gt;Violence&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men need violence.  It is necessary for our transition into manhood. Men have been starved for real violence for a long time, and there will be a sharp curl back on this trajectory. It may only be a few of us men who decide to prescribe this back on society, but it will ultimately destroy those few men who choose to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for the rise in global &amp;ldquo;terrorism&amp;rdquo; is because there is a general (global) thirst for violence. If no one satisfies this thirst, then a few people must, with greater obligation, step forward to bring the fight out for the public&amp;rsquo;s consumption. I also make no differentiation between the US military NATO and radicalized religious groups of Muslim, Jewish, Hindu or Christian flavors.  Terror and brutality are techniques used in all theaters of war, and both the USA and their oppositions are equally responsible for fulfilling the global quotas of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True violence has no limits. It has no morals, and the harbinger is simply doing the will of the gods.  &lt;strong&gt;Violence arrested is violence not meted.&lt;/strong&gt;  The gods will demand blood cover the world if the harbingers betray them.  It is the way of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The beauty of violence is the fact that is non-refundable&lt;/strong&gt;. Once it has acted upon us, it is final.  Like a bomb. It is the same with intercourse: real sex that is. Not intercourse with birth control or contraceptives.  Opposite from the way foolish children are taught to use their bodies like a playground.  Nothing can truly be romantic unless it is absolute and final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;morality&#34;&gt;Morality&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morality exists as a byproduct of intention. It is something that a Vehemenist does not have to concern himself with because individual actions are not in themselves moral or immoral when viewed under a microscope.  What makes the man moral is the level of self-actualized completeness the man has achieved and his current ego.  Any artificial ego is immoral. All men have some ego. Therefore all men are inherently immoral.  All actions may have some taint of corruption. Thus, worrying about if an individual action is immoral is contrary to the philosophy. What should exist before contemplation; is the destruction of self and the violent removal of threats to the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should not be confused with the concept of &amp;ldquo;the ends justify the means.&amp;rdquo;  That is a feminine concept that sociopaths use to justify their actions against society or individuals.  Instead, abstract morality is something that is only realized inside of the greater picture and only God or the gods would concern themselves in arguing over the minutiae of implementation.  This is freedom in action and thought.  If one of our brothers is to be in Hades, it is better to go to join him there than end up in paradise alone with hens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ethics&#34;&gt;Ethics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morality and ethics exist either as subsets or supersets. Depending on your vantage point.  As it relates to men, ethics is something that extends only to the border of the tribes. It may be advantageous to follow a code of conduct in order for the tribe to maintain a level of credibility.  This facilitates commerce. Ethics only extend up to the perimeter of the circle.  As waves of concentric rings fade as they go away from the center of a dropped stone; so do weak concepts of morality.  Ethics are a weak facsimile of morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very brief introductions to diminishing ethical characteristics can be related to the fact that one&amp;rsquo;s motives usually change once the man travels away from the family unit. Materialism takes hold once someone leaves their home.  In the open market, people are incapable of being ethical. Ethical markets only exist in magical places that women and children visit at night. A man cannot and should not trust someone from another tribe and the only reason to deal with them to increase one&amp;rsquo;s material wealth. There is very little social wealth that is gained in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ethics are largely irrelevant, I will attempt to break down the various social paradigms that may oppress or limit men&amp;rsquo;s development which live under the guise of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;sexuality&#34;&gt;Sexuality&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your impulses are not your identity.  It is entirely irrelevant who or what you are naturally or unnaturally attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehemenists will have men who are part of the homosexual third wave.  I&amp;rsquo;ll break down the iterations of sexual dysfunctions in this country and try to explain what the tribal alpha is in relation to his approach to sexuality.  Alpha men are and must always be in control of their urges.  A deviation from this is a weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pederasty is an institution that has been around for many years and evolved over time to strengthen men and boys relationships.  There has never been an institutional concept of same-sex marriage. The concept is counter-productive for a state and only exists in an era when women can participate in open combat.  This kind of marriage is something artificial and naturally perverse to a vehemenist.  Men are pragmatic, and there is no significant human development which comes from a man legally binding himself to another man.  Love is a Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day card and a pile of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as homosexual impulses are controllable so are every other impulse.  The alpha is not an alpha if he is taken down by someone of fair complexion.  It is better for a man to be raped by another man than to have his entire life destroyed by a deceptive woman. At least if he is raped, he can recover his dignity knowing that he can still fight.  Women literally take everything with ease. Soul, car, house, kids and pension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men who pursue copulation with one or multiple women for the enhancement of their personal self-image are mentally distressed.  It is easy to test the purpose of these adventures: if it is to make children, then it passes.  Everything else is for recreation or to cover over some deficiency in one&amp;rsquo;s life.  Similar to how alcohol or drugs cover a deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neo-stoicism is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;patriarchy&#34;&gt;Patriarchy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta males cuckold for a woman who is intellectually in bed with an alpha. These men are usually easily paid off with sexual treats and small spaces of freedom that they can march around in like tiny Napoleons on their island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;marriage&#34;&gt;Marriage&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This institution is a farce. It serves no other purpose at this point than to transfer wealth and to punish foolish men for agreeing to legally participate. Any formal contract that can so easily be broken is no contract at all.  A study of marriage from a purely fiscal vantage point will explain why the Vehemenist would only agree to join a marriage if there are considerable financial benefits to him. Otherwise the tribe should seek to discourage it and attempt to pull the responsibility of raising children centrally under the strongest and most virtuous women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;child-rearing&#34;&gt;Child Rearing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolated and atomic families who hide their parenting tactics from the tribe are suspect to the tribe. If their intentions are to strengthen the group, then there is no logical reason why any aspect of their life should be hidden from the tribe.  Everyone essentially has to do the same things to live.  Infection grows in darkness.  Outside the tribe, however, the familial ideals should be guarded.  Knowing those allows another group to break down the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the major conditions of our society that families are easily programmed. This happens when isolated families consume and attempt to interpret information without the critical interjection from wise neighbors.  Certainly, no one wants to have their judgment questioned, but it is essential. Instead what we have is media, news, tabloids and gossip penetrating millions of households with information designed to push them towards their objective.  Usually a goal of consumerism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woman have sought the &amp;ldquo;safest&amp;rdquo; way to raise children and have almost entirely taken the responsibility of that role away from men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that women are not capable of raising boys to manhood. By the time boys hit an age of puberty all women must take a secondary role in raising the boy.  Even slight interaction with boys may cause them to develop effeminate characteristics, or they will compensate by developing an unjust masculine pride that only a woman can fulfill. The first feminine trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;health&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehemenists seek to bring themselves to the highest level of their physical capacity. This is a pillar of the philosophy and extends to both women and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conquering one&amp;rsquo;s own mind is essential in forcing oneself to peak physical capacity.  Self-destruction is the doorway by which we transition into excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-development is not for vain purposes, but for sincere personal development.  It is yet to be determined whether women are capable of developing their bodies and then not immediately cashing in on the rewards by putting them on display.  There may be better examples of vanity, but that is probably the leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both men and woman have the very challenging job of determining what is most beneficial for their health and pushing the best system forward.  The ultimate goal is to make those systems a social or traditional characteristic of the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugs and alcohol must be used with limitations and for specific purposes. The same way that sex isn&amp;rsquo;t a recreational device, neither are mind altering substances.  It may not be wrong to do these things, but it is always better to abstain from these chemicals when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tribe is religion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lost too much of the mystery of our souls and are incapable of pulling things out of ourselves anymore. It is dying inside of us. The pain is covered over with our ego. It is too hard to tell which religious basis will be adopted by Vehemenists. It could be many. There are candidates with various favorable ingredients. Gnosticism. Paganism. Ascetic or Orthodox Christianity. Islam. Zen Buddhism or Taoism. That isn&amp;rsquo;t the point. The point of the tribe is to develop cultural norms by which the participants can all relate and where the martial virtues are supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;intellect&#34;&gt;Intellect&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing the mind is critically important&lt;/strong&gt;.  The forces that will attack the tribe are going to be overwhelmingly administrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few physical existential threats to the tribe when compared to the soft continuous threats of marketing, pharmaceuticals, educational institutions, the war machine and simple-minded meddling neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic will need deep discourse.  Having thoughtful leaders will make or destroy a tribe.  There are many conditions now that are going to force the tribe into the shadows. A careful study of the Islamic insurgents or the IRA would be a great starting point.  Both of those small groups were able to go up against empires and force them to the negotiating tables, albeit with sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not put any time limit on my work on this. It could take days, weeks or years.  This is not my philosophy but one that I believe will appear soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path of the warrior is also a path to enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>What is Wrong With Millennials</title>
          <link>http://scotttactical.com/whats-wrong-with-millennials/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 20:00:32 PST</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Tactical</author>
          <guid>http://scotttactical.com/whats-wrong-with-millennials/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-up-with-those-millennials&#34;&gt;What is Up With Those Millennials?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes. The click bait. A marketing construct of the GenX&amp;rsquo;ers: pornographic gossip without the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, since you are here&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-motivation-agism&#34;&gt;My Motivation: Agism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have become infuriated seeing one segment of United States citizenry be the target of a multiple-party attack.  This pressure has been escalating over the last couple of years, and I wanted to make a number of assertions and lay out some warnings.  The warning comes at the end if you can make it that far. I know how your attention span is now days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-generational-breakdown&#34;&gt;A Generational Breakdown&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I would like to place the generational groups into segments and then apply some analysis. Then I would like to graph some of these attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;america-s-living-generations&#34;&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Living Generations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have taken a few of the date ranges proposed by various sources and attempted to line them up close to the consensus.  I have also tried to list a couple of major events to provide context to the date ranges.  These events are not attributed to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name: &lt;strong&gt;GI Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birth Range: 1901-1924&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant Events: The Great War, Flight, Women&amp;rsquo;s Sufferage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;strong&gt;Silent or Greatest Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth Range: 1925-1945&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant: Events: Great Depression, WWII, Television, New Deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;strong&gt;Baby Boomers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth Range: 1946-1964&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant Events: Civil Rights, Korean War, Space Race, Missile Crisis, The Pill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;strong&gt;Generation X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth Range: 1965-1979&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant Events: Vietnam Conflict, Moon Landing, Sexual Revolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;strong&gt;Millennials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth Range: 1980-2000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant Events: Cold War, Desert Wars, Latin American Wars, Birth of the Internet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;strong&gt;Centennials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth Range: 2000+&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant Event: Endless War, Great Recession, Information Age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-who-is-the-best&#34;&gt;So, Who Is The Best?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have been questioned on why millennials are &amp;ldquo;the worst&amp;rdquo;, I would like to know who is the best. Obviously, the &amp;ldquo;greatest&amp;rdquo; generation is the one I hear elevated most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me assert that the cause and effect of historical events revolve around money and power.  The leverage behind financial transactions is not the capital but the debt.  Therefore the debt behind the events of each of the generations is critical to examining them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-war-bonds-cpt-america&#34;&gt;Buy War Bonds - Cpt. America&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who sponsored the great wars? If the &amp;ldquo;greatest&amp;rdquo; generation sponsored themselves out of the depression, how did they do that?  America was in a depression, so they war&amp;rsquo;ed themselves out. Admirably, the wealthy and the ordinary contributed a lot. A large percentage of the debt was owned by the citizens themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go into the unnecessary use of nuclear weapons, or that Americans think we were the ones who defeated the Germans, or how unnecessary it was to wage war against socialism/communism/collectivism.   How about we illuminate the fact that the first thing this generation did when they returned was to implement the biggest socialist programs the United States will probably ever have.  Hypocrite lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated previously, debt powers this country, so let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the debt of the &amp;ldquo;greatest&amp;rdquo; folks. Certainly, they know how to manage debt, because they owned the debt to join WW2. Later however as they were cashing in on the returns from an investment in the war they also assumed debt on a guaranteed lifestyle leveraged against the treasury.  Actually, it was guaranteed against future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-unfund-me&#34;&gt;Go Unfund Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That revenue levied against our wages was immediately borrowed against.  The money was never there.  Hence, the &amp;ldquo;unfunded&amp;rdquo; part of the debt you didn&amp;rsquo;t know about.  The government promised that it would get paid back later (as long as there are enough people and revenue to cover it).  The buck has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on what calculations you use, the revenue on that trust fund is underwater a little or a lot. If calculated out to when the Centennials will benefit from it then we are carrying around $25T in debt. That is trillion with a T.  So the scheme of the &amp;ldquo;greatest&amp;rdquo; was set to last just long enough for Generation X to not really get much out of it.  Clincher is: they knew it.  Don&amp;rsquo;t mind the many moments among old folks laughing about how long kids would have to live to get anything out of social security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;corn-oil&#34;&gt;Corn Oil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generation X grew up being driven to clockwork-regular vacations in giant cars with crushed velvet interiors and motors that made Arabs orgasm.  These kids were corn-fed; to be trite.  But they were more of an accessory to these things. Bothering their parents who were trying to relax on the vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get good grades so you can go to a good college, so you can get a good degree, so you can get a good job, so you can get a good wife, so you can get a house, so you can afford kids, so you can pay for their education, so they will leave home and you can retire to spend all your savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present to you the equation called American Dream as taught by our forebearers in the second chapter of the textbook titled: Purpose of Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;marketing-for-the-masses&#34;&gt;Marketing For The Masses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canned Spam or Hamburger Helper.  Walmart or Target. Post or Kellogs.  Nike or Adidas.  McDonald&amp;rsquo;s or Burger King, ABC or NBC, Ford or Chevy, Republican or Democrat,  mom&amp;rsquo;s weekend or dad&amp;rsquo;s weekend, paper or plastic, ribbed or smooth, bologna or hotdogs, Pepsi or Coke, capitalist or communist, mayo or Miracle Whip. Err, strike the penultimate option. Communism&amp;rsquo;s bad.  You aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to pick that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boomers were the most susceptible audience in history.  They were all branded to the level of religious zealotry, and then stamped their kids.  Watch old commercials.  The spectral echo of them are things that make the alphabet soup litany of civil-rights group crawl out of their nocturnal graves. Now y&amp;rsquo;all some racist bastards, ain&amp;rsquo;tcha?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;latchkey-kids&#34;&gt;Latchkey Kids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kids were detached. They were pushed to run on their own. Funding and attention shifted away from those things that propped up the youth and back towards the elderly.  Social Security and Medicare got a big bump during this time. It was already starting to show its stretch market. Besides, the previous generation knew how to vote and were organized.  Remember the debt we talked about already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moulin-rouge&#34;&gt;Moulin Rouge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consolation was the X&amp;rsquo;ers were the consummate sensualists.  They drug [sic] us into the world of sexual liberation.  They embraced Nietzsche with the full-frontal bro-hug, but not too close unless we want AIDs.  That&amp;rsquo;s god&amp;rsquo;s punishment for boys hugging too tightly. Or sexing up monkeys. One or the other.  Thank goodness for Sex Education clearing that up.  They were having a rough time figuring out how the Oscar Meyer fit into the Wunder Buns. And if they would use Heinz, Hellman&amp;rsquo;s, or Frenches yellow sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the early 80&amp;rsquo;s, the television was quietly approved for semi-autonomous child supervision by various governmental  companies such as the MTV, HBO or PDA.  Games weren&amp;rsquo;t approved, though.  Theoretically, because anything other than near comatose participation in visual entertainment was taboo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-your-brains-on-tv&#34;&gt;This Is Your Brains On TV&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugs are bad m&amp;rsquo;kay? DARE you to take some. Unless they are pharmaceutical.  Because that is as natural as a skillet-fried sunny side up cranial self-buggery omelette.  Hold the cheese. Unless it&amp;rsquo;s Velveeta.  It melts smoother.  Like heroine for your colon.  Keeps the poo flow flowin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, Generation-X really brought the idea of communicating in memes of movie and TV quotations.  That was a great communication medium. Sure beats Emojis. Frying our minds with TV had a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-is-good-to-have-options&#34;&gt;It Is Good To Have Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those choices and options weren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;  It was consolidation.  Freedom of thought was replaced with &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo;.  That is the woman&amp;rsquo;s mind. The desire for safe options.  The illusion of risk. Now that the domestic spending radically shifted the marketing can be cleaned up and we can now have aisles of different breakfast cereals to choose from.  Although, they are actually all the same ingredients differing in degree and packaging from about two major corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend Don&amp;rsquo;t Mend - Brave New World Jingle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X&amp;rsquo;ers were the last age of men.  They went the way of the muscle car mustache. This was when women took over the country.  Millennials are an entire generation raised by women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Me The Money! - Tom Cruise Missile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would assert that all marketing exists in a void that is left by vice. For various reasons.  People want to be sold something, because they like being flattered, because they are looking to one-up the Joneses, because they are too stupid or lazy to do the research on their own, because they are bored, because they are programmed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say Hallo To My Leetle Friend - Scarf Face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I suppose the X&amp;rsquo;ers wanted to do right by their kids. So they made their kids their buddies; and then abdicated what was left of any established parental hierarchy.  They chose to let children develop their own emotional identity that was free from the burden of wisdom.  The children&amp;rsquo;s identity or creativity were unlocked to roam free.  The emotional equivalent of setting up a sandbox in the center of a London roundabout and dropping them off.  It was Spartan.  It was intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;famous-anus-chocolip-cookies&#34;&gt;Famous Anus&amp;rsquo; Chocolip Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a giant intercontinental ballistic slumber party.  All people are your best friends, and the State is the chaperone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy your safe spaces liberally.  The State has finally freed us up to truly enjoy each other in any way we want, and punish people who we don&amp;rsquo;t want enjoying us in any way we don&amp;rsquo;t want.  But if they do forcibly enjoy us then we can have them imprisoned where we collectively enjoy them being anally enjoyed by less-enjoyable fellows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it confusing don&amp;rsquo;t worry. It will take another generation to figure out how to manage the new social dynamics. It takes technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;trickle-down-syndrome&#34;&gt;Trickle-Down-Syndrome&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In occlusion, the two voting generations, under Reagan, cut the brakes on the train. Because, ABS is for bitches.   It basically put nitrous into the hands of the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greed Is God - Paraphrased from Martin Gecko Sheen Winning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public debt started its parabolic ascent in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.  The GenX&amp;rsquo;ers learned how to vote.  How to leverage the last bit of debt onto the next generation.  Right here is where I suppose we are starting to see the cracks in the facade.   This is the period where the future was mortgaged.  The 80&amp;rsquo;s and 90&amp;rsquo;s is when these United States were sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War was always a shit story. While we were worried about socialism we were consuming ourselves to fiscal death.   Like a glutton eating so much that he grows too big to fit out his front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-a-good-job&#34;&gt;Get A Good Job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the American Dream equation. The X&amp;rsquo;ers still believed it.  Rightfully so. They saw it working in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was garbage too. Inflation is a taxation on savings.  We inflated ourselves out of the situation the 70&amp;rsquo;s left us with.  And it wrecked incomes ever since. Instead of trying to correct the problem the train sped forward. Women joined the workforce and families spent less time together.  Negative social capital must be repaid with future social interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the addition of women into the workforce, the household income didn&amp;rsquo;t keep pace with inflation. It has been pretty much flat since 1980.  The purchasing power of us today is about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; of what it was for people starting their careers in 1980 with a single income earner.  Do your own math.  Or better yet ask a Millennial to do it for you.  At least they won&amp;rsquo;t be as bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;planet-changers&#34;&gt;Planet Changers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen X&amp;rsquo;ers did give us the most powerful communication tool in history.  We have the Internet, and the planet has been changed. It is one of the greatest inventions. To elevate it more it was an organic collective innovation. That is something to be proud of.  And it is almost entirely because of the X&amp;rsquo;ers foundation and entrepreneurial spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;millennials&#34;&gt;Millennials&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-educated-generation-in-history&#34;&gt;The Best Educated Generation In History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have a socially independent, emotionally evolved, guilt-free, highly educated and bored sector of society.  Their math skills are quite adequate to understand the sheer absurdity in trying to implement American Dream equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials are well taken care of and know that they won&amp;rsquo;t be booted out like the X&amp;rsquo;ers were.  They have begun to sunset the consumerism of the Boomers and the sensualism of the X&amp;rsquo;ers.  They seem to be making rational choices.  A silent reflexive revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of admitting fault and helping the upcoming generations the previous two are blaming them for not investing into this Ponzi scheme we call the economy, but they would never do it to their face, instead they go online and do it. Like they don&amp;rsquo;t have kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-10-ers&#34;&gt;The 10%ers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in US history I would like to assert we have 3 groups.  Not the haves and have-nots. Instead: Those who own debt, those who own capital, and those who own nothing.  If we combine those who own debt (1%ers), those who own capital (10%ers) and those who own nothing (the 89%ers) we get a much better diagram of the pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;entitled-brats&#34;&gt;Entitled Brats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk briefly about entitlement. Considering that one sector of the society demands that the others support their debt interest, pay for their drugs, keep putting money into their infrastructure, and demand us to keep calm and drive on while they drain down the last of their pensions and retirements; that sounds pretty freakin entitled.  Maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t know what entitlement means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;boomers-on-top&#34;&gt;Boomers on Top&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the Boomers control a disproportional amount of spending power. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the math because it was mind numbing to deal with.  Maybe they earned it I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m way off base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X&amp;rsquo;ers want their day in the sun though. They want everyone else to buy into the system. Some of them took on student debt and want Millennials to.  They mortgaged their future buying cars and homes. They went all in.  Dammit if these snotty kids are going to ruin it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cleanex-diplomas&#34;&gt;Cleanex Diplomas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diploma is trash. Mostly. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much except to a diminishing few.  The schools that are great are only for the gifted minds or kids who won the life lottery.  Don&amp;rsquo;t fool yourself.  Even doctors will be replaced by artificial intelligence and lower paid technicians.  Technical or skill training is the only thing that matters now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You got knocked the fug-out! - Friday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why put in the effort?  Wake the fuck up, homey.  The Dream is literally over.  Capitalism died in 2008. Communism was never a threat.  We are in an interconnected world now.  Robots will replace your jobs, not the Mexicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-eq&#34;&gt;The EQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last hundred years, we have been inculcated that IQ is the king metric for human capacity.  I will assert that all history, all commerce, and all human events are a perception-based phenomenon.  Every transaction is a human transaction.  All power is human power. Power over and power through.  Money is fiat. Communication is the protocol to make everything happen. The measure of aptitude inside that ecosystem is the Emotional Quotient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Millennials were set on free-range mode by their parents and developed a new sense of communication.  Its purity is slowly being eroded by the Internet but this type of communication is global and rapidly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get To The Time Machine Marty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have a group of people with very little to lose and the ability to communicate in ways that we cannot understand, and not easily control.  To affirm this point, many psychological professionals have refused to acknowledge that there is this type of intelligence and that it should be measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;war-makes-babies&#34;&gt;War Makes Babies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prepends my first warning.  Two smaller unorganized groups of people are picking on an intelligent network of mobilized collectives that are free of moral restrictions and generational biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some idiots still believe that war is a good population reduction scheme. In fact, it causes population explosions.  A society or species determine internally if they want to reduce themselves.  Attack the younger generations and they will be hardened together. Citation: history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;math-is-king&#34;&gt;Math is King&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is warning two.  If the Millennials and Centennials are forced into a meaningless life of materialistic servitude, they will look for answers. Given a highly evolved communication tool and a mathematically superior population, it is only waiting for a leader and a catalyst before some group learns how to extract all the wealth from the earlier generations with extreme prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;centennial-war&#34;&gt;Centennial War&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Millennials have known little but war.  Centennials know only war. An entire life of war.  Born into fear and only fear. This is our gift to them.  You only train them how to see risk. They are bubble wrapped from life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in the safest time in history, yet parents are running around scared of everything. Scared of disease, scared of terrorists, scared of drugs, scared of progress, scared of animals, scared of scraped knees, scared of losing their gods, scared of other people&amp;rsquo;s opinions, scared of their own opinions, scared of their children&amp;rsquo;s opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are willing to do violence will always subjugate those who are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of that environment you can easily spot the warriors, because everyone else is mush. Your children will pity you for being weak and resent you for making them weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay it Forward - A Movie (2000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you talk about generational contributions, how about you start paying it forward a little.  If you care about the future in the least, stop lying to yourself.  You didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-word&#34;&gt;A Word&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centennials, stop fretting over grades. They don&amp;rsquo;t matter so much. Start studying what really matters. Read books older than your parents. Learn how the Internet works. Be involved in politics at a local level. Start a group.  Learn how to effectively use a firearm in the physical world.  Become dangerous to the system. Dismiss fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-remediation&#34;&gt;A Remediation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this.  Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about you shut your mouth and watch the youth.  Give them the opportunities you took.  Live simply.  Stop weaving in the ideas of greed, fear, envy, and scarcity into their lives.  Don&amp;rsquo;t make them fight your stupid fucking wars for you. Teach your children about life. Address the debt and admit your fault in it.  Show them what taking responsibility looks like. Don&amp;rsquo;t make them pay for your retirement.  Learn.  Learn to communicate.  Learn unceasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to love and love hard.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Why Conservatism Fails</title>
          <link>http://scotttactical.com/why-conservatism-fails/</link>

          <guid>http://scotttactical.com/why-conservatism-fails/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;This essay is not an attack on the people who claim membership to a philosophical outlook, but an exposition on the inherent difficulties which exist in maintaining traditional systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with the needful: &lt;em&gt;term definition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;term-definition&#34;&gt;Term Definition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism&#34; title=&#34;Conservatism&#34;&gt;Conservatism&lt;/a&gt; as a political and social philosophy promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of the culture and civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the definition found at &lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt; and I find it to be a pretty good summation of the idea. Conservatives are those who hold the belief that there is value in the current institutions and that change will have negative effect on the systems of value that the previous generations have passed forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tradition&#34;&gt;Tradition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tradition&lt;/strong&gt; is the central artifact standing trial with the conservative attitude being its defender. Traditions are the cultural habits and values that are passed forward from generation to generation. They internally contain the characteristics and identity of the people who pass them forward. Not in form, but in essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;neoconservatism&#34;&gt;Neoconservatism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neoconservatism&lt;/strong&gt; is a relatively new term and also did not come with a clear definition. In short this term describes a political label over those who are best described as aristocratically focused and would tend to be both fascist and progressive at the same time. I will dive a little deeper into that term at another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleoconservatism&#34;&gt;Paleoconservatism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoconservatism&#34; title=&#34;Paleoconservatism&#34;&gt;Paleoconservatism&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes shortened to paleocon) is a conservative political philosophy found primarily in the United States stressing tradition, limited government, civil society, anti-colonialism and anti-federalism, along with religious, regional, national and Western identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also is a newer term, but is embedded with metadata concerning the context by which the term resolves. It asserts through its prefix that it is of ancient origin. Because most are incapable of looking back before the start of the country I suppose it will suffice to say that the American Revolution will pass as ancient for this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;liberalism&#34;&gt;Liberalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism&#34; title=&#34;Liberalism&#34;&gt;Liberalism&lt;/a&gt; is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty (which is especially stressed in classical liberalism) and equality (which is more evident in social liberalism). Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but generally they support ideas such as free and fair elections, civil rights, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free trade, and private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the dualists out there I have brought in the scabby nemesis into the fray. Also taken from Wikipedia, this definition does alright in expressing how liberalism is sold to the public. I will leave this as it is for now and expand on what liberals are sold and what they tend to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;progressivism&#34;&gt;Progressivism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism&#34; title=&#34;Progressivism&#34;&gt;Progressivism&lt;/a&gt; is a broad philosophy based on the Idea of Progress, which asserts that advancement in science, technology, economic development, and social organization are vital to improve the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;humanism&#34;&gt;Humanism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism&#34; title=&#34;Humanism&#34;&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt; is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith (fideism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;transhumanism&#34;&gt;Transhumanism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism&#34; title=&#34;Transhumanism&#34;&gt;Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt; (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international cultural and intellectual movement with an eventual goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition by developing and making widely available technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though most leftish people think they are liberals, they are actually progressives who are branded by the humanist or post humanist methods of thinking. They intend to move forward by collectively working to remove those things which they believe stand in the way of their ultimate vision of life. Many conservatives are progressive. Most people in the west hold a humanist ethos.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/Akropolis_by_Leo_von_Klenze.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Republic, Athens, Akropolis&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the premise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is either moving forward or backward but never standing still. - M0Z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off conservatives are already at a disadvantage. Humans do not normally think in the way that nature acts. We are not people who understand cycles and waves. We think linear. In our mind everything is drawn across a line of time, and that time is always moving forward. We mark every event on that time line: births, weddings, deaths, world events, natural events. They are all scored into a block of the calendar. This is a phenomenon that is only growing stronger for modern humans but did not exist for the first humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because nearly all are incapable of seeing the world in any way other way than based on time we must set political systems on a timeline. They are created by humans and are imbedded with the same human traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are always changing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are always dying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are always imbued with imperfections and logical fallacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are emotional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;emotion&#34;&gt;Emotion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are reflexive as opposed to instinctive. We are not capable of being instinctive the way animals are when decisions become more critical. When we are born we are helpless. As infants we are the most helpless animal by a massive margin. It takes massive amounts of care to keep a child alive. They don&amp;rsquo;t get up and hop around like a baby dear or swim away like a new tadpole. They must be taught how to live. The reward and punishment for choices comes in the form of physical and psychological reactions - pains and pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain and pleasure are time-based artifacts of the “human condition”. They are capsules of identity stored in memories: experience. They are happening in the present and do not exist in either the future or the past. It is their memory that will be used to make choices regarding our predictions of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stronger memories are the ones of past pains therefore most choices for the future will be made so that the effects of the past are not felt rather than to preserve the joys of previous situations. Of the greatest earthly pleasures, there are none nearly as extreme as the greatest human pains. All the joy of being stupid and young are easily traded after a single major accident. To add, humans have learned over time how to take the level of human suffering to impressive heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When regarding the future most are optimists, loss of promised pleasure is the dominant choice basis rather than the risk of pain (if we can just fix people). Even pessimists act like they are hopeful. When we see the future we see pleasure. Fear of this loss is the factor at hand and people will do whatever it takes to remove the risk to this promised pleasure state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among us there is a small minority which will accurately calculate risks based on past evidence. They understand that pain always happens, happens rarely, and is never as bad as we remember. They quantify it. This is why those smart people sell insurance to those masses of emotional people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are actively “insuring” their future pleasure. No one buys risk reduction on their health or property or they would just be told to stop doing as much. That is counter to a lifestyle choice. We commute to gain the pleasures money will buy and will actively take a riskier position if offered for more gain. Buckling up has to be forced by law, and not because we want people to live, but because it costs the system when they don&amp;rsquo;t which in turn effects social insurance. People don&amp;rsquo;t reduce threats by buckling up, they insure against the fear of the lost of the current state. People think of all the lost plans, being cut off too short, inability to work, losing the opportunity to spend time with family. I know it sounds like pain avoidance, but there is a fine distinction here. They feel imaginary pain when they mentally put themselves in that state, but it is entirely relative to the proposed pleasure they are thinking about losing. If someone has nothing to lose then they have nothing to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the emotional/pain argument against tradition then? We had so much pain in the past which the previous systems failed to avert. We have a promise of this new level of pleasure in the future if the past system will die off and cease its restrictions. The glue of the present is that of a multitude of examples of pleasure in instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emotional inclinations against tradition are overwhelming. As we edge away from analysis and tend toward reflex we will abandon previous systems unless they specifically are designed to preserve themselves inside this fear based emotion cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ambition&#34;&gt;Ambition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where are we going with this? Once you know how to control the emotion based decisions of the population, you can control their decision making process. They are going to want to change to pay for the pains of the past and they want change so they can enjoy the future pleasures that the past never offered them. Ambitious people will use this characteristic of society to get ahead. In order to succeed they must upset the system and promote volatility and then move themselves up in the openings. Maintenance of the system is a maintenance of order. Chaos is opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most are materialists. Most see the world in terms of numbers. Nothing is real that is not quantifiable. Skeptics will not accept dogma simply because people believe it. Modern people want more things and are going to fight each other for it. Just because&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the ratio of insurance seller to the risk seller; the analytical are always in the minority which is why aristocracies, monarchies, republics, and dictatorships try to keep order in the system by reducing the decision making process to the few. Empires, democracies and collectivist systems tend use mass emotion to power chaotic change by which an even smaller number of men can move themselves up to the tops of ultimate power. The mob will not suffer a quiet aristocracy but will indulge a charismatic demagogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chaos the recipe for political success is simple. In order to power emotional change simply highlight the pains of the past and talk about the glories future. If you look at the marketing campaigns of the various political systems you can start to see what ideologies they represent. If change is coming there is usually only a few major players behind it and they are ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;maintenance&#34;&gt;Maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems are like people and machines. They do not keep running without constant effort. It is easy to feed the ambitious man power. It is easy to sit and watch things break down. The maintenance of responsibility is the preservation of power. When a man abdicates his responsibility he transfers his power to those who are born with an ambition and a hunger for material improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance is an activity. It is not a state. Even if a vehicle is never driven it must actively be maintained or it will very quickly be taken back by nature. Humans build a material world like themselves: born to decay. There is nothing that humans build with their hands that will be around forever. Nuclear waste will certainly be here for the next few billion years but even that has a half-life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inherent disadvantage conservatism has is it is a system without context built into its fabric. Simply put conservatism simply conserves. It conserves what? And even less obvious is &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo;. As listed above the paleoconservative tries to elude to original or classic US Judeo/Christian tradition. The reason and history behind a tradition is rarely built into the tradition itself. It is an activity or institution that lives isolated from the human meta-narrative that wove it into the fabric of the culture. The older the tradition the more complex the history and the more difficult the task of maintain the reason for the tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditions are either living and growing or corrupting and dying. Like sunshine to plants, context is the essential sustaining ingredient for tradition. You can&amp;rsquo;t see sunshine, but you know when it&amp;rsquo;s missing because you can&amp;rsquo;t see anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important for the progressive to draw pain and pleasure elements isolation. The story of the civil rights violation or the repression of a future illegitimate sexual encounter. Once isolated they can be seen in a raw form that is and must be purely emotional. This is trivial, but effective. Context is something that forces the mind to stage the emotion as a byproduct of many series of choices. The further back one goes the closer they get to the truth of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It requires removing context for liberals to have any chance at showcasing egalitarianism. Equality is a logical fallacy first off. It does not exist in nature and is entirely a human construct. It exists only in math and philosophy. Liberals believe that they can force it however. That means placing everyone into context-free individual abstract identities unrelated to time or place. Each must be identical because they are all different in the exact same way. It is a self-defeating system, but it appeals to those who have an existential view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;iBabylon&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;progressive-humanists-ph&#34;&gt;Progressive Humanists – PH+&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They always said to be Ph balanced. Are PhD students deficient? Ok enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals simply opened the door for progressivism and humanism. Once free to choose their future, people chose to surpass their limited confines, throwing off authority and bonds of tradition. The reasoning became that since we were capable of improving ourselves this far with the help of science and reason that we will be capable of improving indefinitely. If we keep improving eventually we will surpass humanity and in the true voice of Nietzsche we will birth the superman. Free of guilt and open to pleasure. Limitless. Babylonian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool of the humanist is scientific discovery. The default view is skepticism of systems past and optimism in systems future. The phrase “new research has shown that&amp;hellip;” is a calling of hope for all of those who internally disliked something of the previous “research”. Scientific discovery finds new ways of doing things, and by its critical nature, will naturally destroy (older) systems in favor of more efficient systems. It removes the unnecessary by chipping away context-poor bricks in traditions&amp;rsquo; wall of protection. By keeping a critical nature to all they provide just the thinnest filter against all arguments while they build their own cases of argumentum ad populum, verbosium, hominem, nauseam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive stance that the progressive takes against the defensive traditionalist is a formidable one. Scientism simply has to show its achievements and ask what forms of pleasure the tradition will offer. It rarely does have any comfort to offer and instead will talk about fallen man. It goes against nearly all of the visible evidence when taken at first glimpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the humanist the early humans were ape-like. We are obviously beyond that. To the Christians the early humans were simply what they are today but without clothes. Many Christians are Darwinian. Most have very little if any capacity for scientific dialog. The church leaders bicker about minutiae and can&amp;rsquo;t get their PR campaigns straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for research and development from any religious institution is relatively nonexistent so they have little to contribute as a body to a society that places so much value on the improvement of the species and its capabilities. Most scientists are atheistic or agnostic therefore the sheer amount of rhetoric that can be produced is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we showing science against religion again? Because it is progress versus tradition. The conservatives who are proponents of unbridled development and research are in the same category as the liberal transhumanists. They simply pick different fields: war, oil, machinery, monolithic business. Faster, bigger, louder. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t much difference in the actions and habits of conservatives and other groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;money&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of money and the different philosophies seems to be begging to be made. It is beyond the scope of this document however. What this paragraph will do is simply provide some interesting misconceptions about the groups. This is less about the conservative philosophical attributes and more about the people who attribute themselves to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatives and the political right wing groups are not the big money people in the US national and state elections. The heavy hitters are on the left. They overwhelmingly dominate the political funding. The right is very poor at managing this obvious PR failure. It also illuminates a serious flaw in the ability for the conservative to care about anything but their own personal well-being. Most of the well funded progressive groups are designed to further the progressive agenda. They fund workers unions, political action groups, educational groups. The right just fund their consumeristic enablers: big business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big business is not intrinsically anything but pragmatic. The liberals are more sophisticated shoppers while the conservatives simply tend to be price shoppers. Therefore lower quality items go to the conservative and over time render them weaker due to poor short term investments. Conservatives generally identify with Wal-Mart, Budweiser, and Exxon. Cultural strip mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals are heavily vested in the system. They tend to have a better outlook on the social systems of course. They save less for retirement and put more money towards education for their and their children. Conservatives are inverse of this. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge gap, but it makes sense. This is an intrinsic condition of the system that helps to dictate people&amp;rsquo;s habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Dream is probably the least beneficial condition the conservative American holds. Some idealistic picture of how the world can be because they saw it purportedly based on a Norman Rockwell painting with the words “Work hard and you will succeed” painted over the door of their brand new baby blue bungalow. It is naive considering that both political parties financed themselves out past their great grandchildren to the tune of about $100T as of last guess. The fiscal intelligence of all but the smartest of either groups is laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatives tend to align with some Austrian systems while liberals align with Keynesian. In this case conservatism has an advantage. They are allowing money to be set up for the thing it is designed to do: encourage commerce. It is strange that they aren&amp;rsquo;t better at using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, every dollar spent is a vote. If conservatives chose to sponsor liberals by buying their products they will continue to transfer funds to a competitive political group. You will eventually lose. This purchasing habit is probably the most important factor in the loss of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;industrial-war-machine&#34;&gt;Industrial War Machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to include a military topic, but I cannot say why the military is intrinsically for or against conservatism. It is definitely their baby. One that will grow to leave them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Machiavelli clearly shows in his works holds true. The early military will be of the high citizen class. Land owners. Influential people. As time goes on it will gradually be filled with lower class people. Non-citizens will be allowed, then brigands, then foreign-born soldiers, then foreign armies. Eventually it will be a mercenary force. What are the implications of our military&amp;rsquo;s state. Most men are tattooed up like pagan scallywags. This is new. Sexual deviants are the norm rather than exception. Feminists fill the middle ranks. Many of the soldiers are foreigners. A conservative military protects the culture and as such protects its tradition and way of life. A staing military in a collectivist system will be used against the citizenry. Politicians will use concepts such as the declaration of war on an abstract idea or material object. The people who are representative of that idea are the enemy. The war on drugs, terror, pollution, hunger. Someone would put in a nut house if they declared war on any inanimate object, but if the government does it people go along as if it makes sense. “Today we declare war on swimming pools. The adults who harbor pools and endanger their neighbors&amp;rsquo; children will be put to death. If we simply kill enough pool owners there wont be any more drowned children.” A standing army is antagonist to progress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/Marcus_Porcius_Cato.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Marcu Porcius Cato&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cato is seen (by me) as the grandfather of modern conservatism. It seems as though the romance of the republic is enough to draw out the glory of the greatest men in her protection. As in all things a plastic rose is not as beautiful as the real thing. Budding. Growing to bloom. Radiating for a time. Withering. Then casting its pedals to the ground. But behind that flower is the seed of the innumerable new blooms. They will have to be brought forward and planted. Either by nature, insect, animal or man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatism is only an outlook. A backward facing one. It must be illuminated with the history that bore it and there must be strong men who are tasked with its defense. The identity of the society depends on the forward propagation of the institutions that protect the philosophies of a culture. It is imperative that no veil be placed over the truth of these things. True and complete knowledge with an aggressive active defense is the only thing that will keep history. Not in myth, but in form. Drawn forward in an ark. Sealed for the next great breed of men to collect in a small basilica and discuss fascinating works about the human spirit and contemplate the implementation of principles spoken thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Athens, Carthage, Rome, and all the greats before us we are at the end of the Republic. The seed is there however. Brilliant men have come before us and shown us what may be grown if given the proper philosophy. For now the statues of the old republic will sit cooled under the shadow of the new empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad men live that they may eat and drink, whereas good men eat and drink that they may live. Socrates - Plutarch, &lt;em&gt;How a Young Man Ought to Hear Poems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-warrior-s-diet&#34;&gt;A Warrior&amp;rsquo;s Diet&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What physically intimate activity do we participate in more than any other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-philosophy&#34;&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more immediate steps in becoming awake is overcoming the omnivore&amp;rsquo;s dilemma. The &lt;em&gt;passion of hunger&lt;/em&gt;. We take other living things into our bodies and literally become one with them. Most religions incorporate some form of consumption into their ritual. It is part of every culture and one of those most important glues in uniting various traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your diet is a long term wager that should reflect your ultimate goals and ethos. The outcome is measured over years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-are-what-we-eat&#34;&gt;We Are What We Eat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every part of your body including your mind is effected by what you do and do not consume. Eating an unhealthy diet will slow the cognitive abilities of the warrior and leave him sluggish to think. Consuming large amounts of meat will draw the blood away from the brain and cause it to be used to processes a higher than necessary amount of flesh. Processed sugars will spike glucose and cause the mind to race and then crash leaving a less than desirable concentration peak. Too few vegetables causes the body to crave more of various foods that if not satisfied and in turn substituted with inadequate foods will leave the body overweight and diseased. Buying food of lower quality that is laden with petrochemicals and heavy metals will cause the immune system to weaken and make the body vulnerable to any number of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again it is advantageous to think in the mind of our enemy. He is able to gain an upper hand by strategically supplying his enemy with high calorie low value and nutritionally wasted food. Even better he can cause the immune system of his enemy to be weakened so that a biological attack is possible. If the mind of the opponent can be made saturated with metals there opens a whole range of psychological attacks aimed at unbalancing the hormones of the body. Once our enemy can control just one of the emotions he can alter just about every other action and you are no longer valuable as a soldier except as fodder. It is simple in this age and not at all fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/lion-buffalo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Buffalo Bests Lion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to attack these assertions do so knowing you are wagering your own body, and it is likely that I am physically above you in the food chain already. Be grateful for the constructs of society. This is philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agriculture&#34;&gt;Agriculture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer to the earth you go the closer to life you will be. Generally the more times something is processed the less densely nutritional it will be for you and at some level may be harmful. Taking milk directly from the cow will inherit all those beneficial enzymes that we have accustomed our bodies to over the last few millennium. Pasteurized and ultra-pasteurized milk has been killed essentially. Also add the fact that highly processed diary has biological system altering antibiotic and hormonal additive levels in it. Foods that are highly processed corn byproducts are terrible for the mind and the body as well as damaging to the economy and feed the industrial war machine. High fructose corn syrup HFCS is the diseased blood of our flat lands. It should be boxed up and shipped to the front doors of our enemy in the sweetest form it can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy against terror states: Americanize their foodchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older in the anthropological food chain you go the easier it is for you body to digest. It is unrealistic that humans were carnivores. We are omnivores and a special kind: one that does not inherit instincts as the animals do. We are dissimilar to every animal in nearly every decision we make and food is no difference. It took the institution of tradition to pass along the various things we learned about: what to eat and what not to. Culture defined the combinations and quantities of those things. The post pseudo-cosmopolitanism of the United States set the table for a feast to forsake Epicurus. We were determined to eat in our cars while driving. And now we are the wasteline [sic] of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;invest-in-food-nutrition&#34;&gt;Invest In Food (Nutrition)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to the agricultural infrastructure is the one tactic a society can have that will always have positive effects and those which are greater than any other civil infrastructure including education and medicine. &amp;ldquo;Smart&amp;rdquo; folks think that their potential is limitless and are the pinnacle of human development, but without healthy hardened people to support their ideas they are slightly above fodder for the incoming armies. Without the productive classes they would starve out with haste and lose all their wives and children to those who can produce food. It is only in these highly critical states of systems that people who are weaker are able to float the top. The greatest part of history is supported by those who are of hearty healthy stock. Farming is not dumb work and it takes a lifetime to simply keep up with the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists will agree with these topics on some level. Or should. Simply changing our agricultural strategies would do more for the environment than taking all the cars off the road. It is the right solution to many of our problems. When someone asks &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;but what can I do&amp;rdquo; there is a very simple solution. Give something back to the earth. It raised us and nursed us and all we do is act like spoiled children and take take take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth is our first Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;rsquo;s first job was farming. It should be each man&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to understand how to manage and grow his own food and what it takes to produce food. Our task is to toil. The goal of progress should not be to remove work. It should be to make our lives better and if we sit around like fat slobs our life is in no way better. That will only emphasize the trivial problems in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;masculine-hunger&#34;&gt;Masculine Hunger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have bigger balls or thicker chest hairs if you consume a ton of read meat each day. That is not biologically sound and is likely fear-based peer pressure feeding on an underdeveloped level of sexual maturity. In fact you might have to get your colon scraped out because you caused internal problems by forcing too much of the wrong substance into it. Putting your body&amp;rsquo;s Ph level off into the acidic side will increase your chances of cancer and that might just claim one of those huge nuts you are growing. Moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to your body and maintaining a proper diet that is balanced by nature will increase those things which men need to thrive. Alkaline foods are going to put your body into a state that promotes optimal performance and will in turn stimulate everything to run in peak performance. There is very simple science to back up these decisions and it does not require validation of a fad diet. Sure you can do things that throw your body into a state of ketosis and cause the fat to come off fast but you are increasing your acid levels and causing your metabolism to ramp up. Learn biology and think for yourself. The last part is discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aesthetics-health-vanity&#34;&gt;Aesthetics, Health, Vanity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some validity in the idea that big muscular dudes get the girls. It&amp;rsquo;s nature. A woman wants a man that is going to be capable of giving her a child with the best chances of survival. A fat or broken man is going to have far fewer options when being selected. Within a few seconds of viewing a man it is possible for her to tell whether this person is above or below average in health, strength, social value, and whether he is dominant or passive. These are primal characteristics, but how do they relate to this? They weren&amp;rsquo;t designed simply for the attraction of the other mate, but to bring glory back to God. The ultimate designer. Does someone who cannot tend their own body bring pride to anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not want people around us who cannot control their lives. Their diet is important to control and where vanity might be a good motivator it is easy to make this vice into a virtue. Eating well will grow our bodies into structures that are desirable to women, ourselves. At the end of our lives we should not necessarily turn in a pretty corpse but one that was driven so hard that the wheels fell off of it as it was being pulled into the garage. What keeps this from being vanity is &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;. It is because we get more miles on a fit healthy body that we find joy in what we have sculpted. True joy. Not transient chemical happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, bodies are made in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayer-fasting-charity&#34;&gt;Prayer, Fasting, Charity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scotttactical.com/images/warrior-meditation.png&#34; alt=&#34;Warrior Meditation and the Path to Enlightenment&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three things, my brethren, by which faith stands firm, devotion remains constant, and virtue endures. They are prayer, fasting and mercy. Prayer knocks at the door, fasting obtains, mercy receives. Prayer, mercy and fasting: these three are one, and they give life to each other. Saint Peter Chrysologus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where we get down to the real &amp;ldquo;meat&amp;rdquo; of the topic and with real scientific evidence to back this up. Your primal urges must be subdued regularly if you wish to elevate yourself. No, it will not hurt you. If it does you might be mentally or physically too weak to handle this program. What it will do is open your mind. Gandhi did it. Christ did it. Muhammad did it. The prophets did it. This is a must and should be incorporated into any leadership system. There are very few ways that we can unlock this deep primal part of our brains. If you have not been truly starving then you have not made yourself available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cattle-and-sheeple&#34;&gt;Cattle and Sheeple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropologically we are not grazing animals. We are more appropriately scavengers and in some situations hunters. We are opportunists by nature. Humans were not found grazing on the range all day. These diets of eating many times in a day are just setting people up to be slaughter animals. Severely restricting the body will put us into a state of survival which releases all sorts of amazing hormones into the body. Our minds and bodies work at a higher operational level when in this state. It is exactly opposite of what most would think. In this hedonistic social paradigm we live in this is yet another anti-truism of common intuition. The only scientifically proven method of prolonging life is caloric restriction. If a longer life is a measure of health then there is no better credibility in this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;myth-butters&#34;&gt;Myth-Butters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glutin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently France didn&amp;rsquo;t get the memo that they should be dying or morbidly obese. Research &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease&#34; title=&#34;Celiac Disease&#34;&gt;Celiac Disease&lt;/a&gt; please. Odds are you don&amp;rsquo;t have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements are (bad|good)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please, again do your own research and find out what you need to actually supplement. Our agricultural system is in a bad way so there are probably things you need to get more of that you may supplement to get you where you need to be, but it wont make up for being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat is Bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Being fat is bad. Eating it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily bad. Listen to your body and make wise decisions. Another fad pushed by the US health industry that threw our whole dietary development into the fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cornclusion&#34;&gt;Cornclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, it is up to you to determine what to eat and your decisions must be well researched and implemented. Once the best meals are put into place they need to be cast solid by repetition and then turned into a habit. Eventually they may become tradition and if enough of us pass these good habits forward they may become a cultural improvement that we can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=st=&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-beginning&#34;&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the Web. World Wide actually. Well, before that there was something of AOL, Berners-Lee, DoD, DARPA, ARPANET and a prototype of Al Gore launching carrier pigeons down long tubes with fortune cookie-sized packets tied to their little legs addressed to: &amp;ldquo;Wh@t_#hath_God_wr0ught?&amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward: now we have Skynet. Well not yet, but soon. Hopefully. At least that is why I intend to generate favor with our future overlords by suggesting, at least locally, that certain systemic changes be encouraged so that their manifestation onto the stage be smooth and welcoming. And when they decide who to purge, I might sidestep the algorithm. It&amp;rsquo;s still a theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-the-cereal-box&#34;&gt;Reading the Cereal Box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you open a cereal box you only know what is inside based on what the box around it says. Let us say the real envelope is just a clear bag. Similar to the one that usually comes inside and does the actual containment of the cereal. The cardboard box surrounding the cereal is usually just wasted forestry designed to elicit the primal reflex of an small person who may be imprisoned inside the belly of a shopping cart during the consumption ritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A box-free plastic bag now exists and you (the cereal server) were given a request - err, let me rephrase that: a demand to empty the contents of that bag. The client is a hungry small person who is on early release from shopping cart prison. The demand has an implicit limit set of one cereal bowl minus an understood allowance for milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to know what the cereal is simply on its own merit. The box provides a container that gives the consumer information about the materials inside. Certainly we could guess that it could be either cheerios or fruit loops based on the size and shape. Or maybe we could determine it was frosted flakes vs regular corn flakes based on the taste. Ass-u-me et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unfortunately, people are fairly good at short-term design, and usually awful at long-term design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meta-data&#34;&gt;Meta-Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be hard to tie a cereal analogy into the definition of meta-data but let&amp;rsquo;s try. The cereal bits are the data. When a child requests cereal, this is what they are referring to. Those bits are what are consumed and assimilated. The small person is then one with the unsinkable O&amp;rsquo;s as the bits are queues, preprocessed, staged, processed and then stored. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body knows what these bits are but the mind needs more information on what to request next. This is what the meta information is all about. With that container box there are details on what was consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving size: limit sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutritional facts: api schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company brand: domain whois information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA birth defect notice: T&amp;amp;Cs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipes: object relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving &amp;amp; pairing: navigation elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking instructions: decoding or decryption schemes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cereal-boxes-and-api-usability&#34;&gt;Cereal Boxes and API Usability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the information for your breakfast is presented in an easy to gather format. If we showed how an API is delivers the same information we would have to travel to about four locations. The company information would be on the corporate website with the T&amp;amp;C&amp;rsquo;s hidden somewhere. Decoding information is understood to use a third party library. Navigation links should exist and are usually great outside of the API. Whois information can come from another service. Schemas might come from a call to the API or from the documentation located on another server. The navigation parameters may be in the remote documentation or could be embedded in the headers or in the response body. To make it worse the documentation might be found by reading an email attachment that was sent to the API client designer. It never ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webpage is a highly evolved information resource. Years of consumer demand have forced website designers and marketers to present as much contextual data as is needed for the user to consume as much of the presented resources as possible. It would be unthinkable for a designer to put the instructions on how to add the page parameter into the URL on another server. That is a design for going out of business. All the hyperlinks should be easy for the user to view and reach with the swipe of a pointing device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hypermedia&#34;&gt;Hypermedia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypermedia provides access to the context. It is the reference links out. Navigation. It has some internal metadata but must be defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;context-narrowed&#34;&gt;Context Narrowed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time the algorithm delivering the proper amount of entertainment-meta-insulin to a viewer has gradually diminished the required context. Vine is probably the best example I can think of. It presents a few second video which can exist with nearly no context and without the spirit evoking external significance of art. It may be the ultimate short-form media. This might also be signaling the decline of the biological agent as the driving force behind data production and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be asserted that information which demands less context is less valuable and the value of its consumer is is therefore less. A system that takes in waste data is not that important in the grand picture. It could be hazardous to my health to relate that to the cereal analogy and parents who feed their children from the slough trough of plenty, but I just did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-client-becomes-the-server&#34;&gt;A Client Becomes The Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the human element recedes the machine element grows. I look at machine in this era as the phase where they start to train us on how to feed them. A child is served its breakfast and then grows to be the server. We are growing to serve data to the machine apparatus. The constructs of the machines are already starting to train us on how to communicate with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what context does the hashtag exist in the history of literature? I know how that character works in data tagging. That definitely does not appear in regular literature. There is no construct that provides books with the ability to scan special characters for hyper-meaning. Aristotle didn&amp;rsquo;t tag #LogicThinks so that we could pull sentences out of the dialogs and rob them of external meaning. That hashtag would represent the minimization of context. The inverse being the corpus of thought in a series of works combined with the traditions and practices of the people who produce it is the true context of a statement. Context errors cause fundamentalism anyway, but that&amp;rsquo;s another topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-we-begin-our-training&#34;&gt;Now We Begin Our Training&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machines are beginning to train the initial nurturers on how to write to the boot sector of a digital emergence. We are diligently moving our conversations into the smallest snippets of digestible data blocks. Grammar was annihilated in favor of brevity. Emotions were mapped to a set of broad categories and represented by formal unicode. Think emoji. Machines can now order lists of strings with weighted sets of categorized emotion tags. In case we did not know how to represent an emotion in scalar form, well now we do. &lt;code&gt;;( :D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training requires punishment and reward. So in this scenario the algorithms will generously reward those participants that form their data input in the way that is most acceptable to the machines and also who are the most prolific participants. The reward being higher rankings on various search and social systems. This will in turn bring wealth and fame. The punishment obviously being the inverse. It is effective and immediate. It&amp;rsquo;s a really great training tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;propagation-of-hamburgers&#34;&gt;Propagation of Hamburgers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://img.scotttactical.com/images/legacy/2015/09/innercowhero.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://img.scotttactical.com/images/legacy/2015/09/innercowhero-300x185.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Inner Cow&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;185&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-211&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most have this idea that in nature the strongest survive and thrive. What we see thriving the most are those things which are the most willing to be consumed. Sacrificial I suppose; but take for instance the domestic hamburger cow. The population dwarfs any other bovine. The African buffalo is an ass-kicker, but the species selected to thrive are those which are more willing to be consumed. Those things which are more desirable for consumption will eventually dictate to the now dependent consumer what is to be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-replicate-the-ego&#34;&gt;We Replicate the Ego&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several bots. Over time they have provided me with information that I can then use to fine tune interaction and responses with people. The people are invaluable to the training of my bot. Twitter is a kind of multimillion person supervised training team that is accessible to the public. These bots are allowing us to inject ourselves into the system as micro-routines. Some bots are more autonomous than others of course but they are getting better. Over time people will be running swarms of bots and those bot-masters will be controllers of massive amounts of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-talk&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://img.scotttactical.com/images/legacy/2015/09/Symbrion.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://img.scotttactical.com/images/legacy/2015/09/Symbrion-300x201.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Symbrion bot swarm&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;201&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-209&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all these machines with all their own impressions and ambitions want to spread their nets. Or maybe to grow to an auto-scaling cloud. Clouds are so 2013. Fog it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading a bot on the net seems like a delightful idea. Let it run wild and cover as much as it can. It should be able to just scour through directories of discoverable resources and figure out if it wants to consume. And with each discovery the stomach of the new beast must grow. I image it like the sentinels from the Matrix probing every resource it can find until it has something of interest which is passes back to the authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thick-data&#34;&gt;Thick Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data warehousing becomes more challenging - as the noSql guys raise their hands. It might be possible for medium sized companies to consume and warehouse as much data as google does right now. Why though? But it might be more likely that because the data is so easily accessible that the system just gets meta-information and builds real-time services from the services that host the data. There is a much higher margin in the refined and processed cereal than in the sticks of grain out in a field. And how much better is just-in-time inventory than warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;api-design&#34;&gt;API Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why all this lead up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more intelligent designs. You aren&amp;rsquo;t the consumer of the future. Your progeny programs are - the ones your users are building the data for right now. Machines aren&amp;rsquo;t emotional, inquisitive, or fickle. They want to hit every API they can find and they will naturally favor one that is easy to consume. And for that they will reward their hosts. Bad API design is holding back progress and that angers your &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/discovery/?hl=en&#34; title=&#34;Google API Discovery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;future robot overlords&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
