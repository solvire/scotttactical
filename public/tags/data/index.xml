      <description>Networking Transceivers This is all pretty new stuff for me. I have been a cat5 ethernet guy since the beginning. There was just never a need to push more data than what I was getting. But now with converged storage that need is quite apparent. After having deployed a MapR-FS and doing a speed test I realized where I needed to make improvements.
Again this page is mostly for my notes.</description>

      <description>Encrypt Your DB Backups I&amp;rsquo;m mostly putting this here for my reference. I do this in multiple projects and always seem to forget where my instructions are.
Generate Keys From your user&amp;rsquo;s home directory:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1000000 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout .ssh/backup_key.pem -out .ssh/backup_key.pem.pub
Fill out the questions appropriately. Or not. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it matters really.
That will create the public and private keys.
backup_key.pem - private key backup_key.</description>

      <description>TL;DR OpenStack is a massive complicated ecosystem. It is only going to survive by the vendors that support it and probably not what you need.
Backstory Let me begin by saying that given the proper talent pool, financial resources, and time; OpenStack probably isn&amp;rsquo;t bad for some people. For most institutions it is just wrong.
I will probably write another article that outlines all the questions that I should have asked before starting this.</description>

      <description>Purdue University Predicts Student Success Using Data Science Most people know that the student who is doing well inside a class may likely prosper in another class, but tend to you anticipate whether students would succeed according to the number of occasions they joined into the campus network?
Using the explosion of information sets available now, Purdue University could evaluate data from hundreds of thousands of excellent and successful graduates, to assist conjecture models for graduation rates as well as on-time graduations.</description>

      <description>How Fast-Growing Data Center Segment Bridges Corporate Networks and the Cloud Companies, searching to achieve the very best performance in the cloud, are putting a greater value on lowering the physical distance between their servers and their respective cloud providers. Colocation data centers, where their machines share space, emerged as a key point in enterprise cloud strategy.
For CIOs, a significant advantage of colocation would be that the closeness to cloud providers makes connections faster.</description>

      <description>Better Communication Through Big Data We&amp;rsquo;ve heard the word &amp;lsquo;Big Data&amp;rsquo; tossed around more recently. This is actually the idea of computationally examining very large data sets to show designs, trends, and associations, especially relevant to human behavior and interactions. Even though it still appears farfetched that the computer algorithm can improve personal connections, a lot of companies really are leveraging fraxel treatments through apps and gamification to enhance connections using their clients.</description>

      <description>Reasons Why Data Centers Are Eco-Friendly Within the thick of the exciting election year, I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to go to politics. Not to endorse one of the candidates or predict a winner, actually, but to recall a telling moment before the inauguration in our current president.
It had been December 2008, when Barbara Walters questioned President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle throughout a prime time ABC television special.</description>

      <description>Text Search - Django Model Fields Django has a pretty flexible ORM, but sometimes clients need a free-form text search to get down to the content that you are looking for. It is beyond the capability of most engineers to build a comprehensive search tool and shoehorn it into an existing application. There are people working on these problems for years.
This does remind me of a senior boss that asked me to add a fuzzy search field to an application and that it was &amp;ldquo;super simple&amp;rdquo;.</description>
