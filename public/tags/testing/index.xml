      <description>PHPUnit Is Slowness I love PHPUnit don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. More than a testing library, I like testing, or having tests. It&amp;rsquo;s like the code got yo back bro! Build code that lasts.
EDIT: I know most of the problems are inherent with tests not the testing framework. However, my requirements dictate how I use it to a certain extent. Peace.
PHPUnit is painfully slow. Seriously. Though. Maybe having a concurrent environment it can run it would help.</description>
