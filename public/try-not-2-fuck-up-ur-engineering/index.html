<p>Leadership Checklist for Non-Technical Managers</p>

<p>How do you build software that provides value to both clients, owners and engineers?</p>

<p>This list has started as a list of notes that I kept over the last few years. Yes, this is the abbreviated version of <a href="/management-for-quality-software-development/">Management For Quality Software</a>.</p>

<h2 id="executive-leadership">Executive Leadership</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bloated and ugly products are born at the top, but a good engineering environment may begin there</li>
<li>The three ways business leaders can add value is with <em>numbers, numbers, numbers</em></li>
<li>Put your name on the product</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-business-requirement">The Business Requirement</h3>

<p>Write a business requirement that reflects specific details about a problem that the business is solving based on market research numbers. A full description is beyond this terse scope.</p>

<h3 id="feature-requests-r-bad">Feature Requests R Bad</h3>

<p>I know you really want to. You think you know UI design and are well versed in using a browser. In reality you probably suck at engineering/UI/art.</p>

<p>See previous paragraph sentence 1.</p>

<h3 id="feature-driven-cycles-suck">Feature-Driven Cycles Suck</h3>

<p>&ldquo;When is the report download page going to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not by the definition in agile dictionaries, but defined as the environment by which business determines short term goals in reference to features.</p>

<h3 id="business-vision">Business Vision</h3>

<ul>
<li>Set a clear vision</li>
<li>Make the vision both short and long term</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pivot</li>
<li>Avoid buzzword glory pitchmen</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="employee-goals">Employee Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Consider the employees goals in your vision</li>
<li>If you do not care about the employees&rsquo; goals then they might set their own</li>
<li>Have an idea of what motivates people (We are not all building rockets or curing cancer)</li>
<li>Make an employee goal the production of a quality product</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optimal-relationships">Optimal Relationships</h2>

<p>A few items here that I look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the team easily share code</li>
<li>Do they internally set group functions (meetings/lunches/after-hours) – can be dangerous</li>
<li>Can they tell you what others are working on</li>
<li>Are there a lot of complaints about coworkers</li>
<li>Ask them who the best employees are</li>
<li>Provide a way to communicate problems to leadership</li>
</ul>

<p>Devs need <a href="https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/12/">CS 666 Political Science</a> training. Seriously.</p>

<h2 id="hire-the-right-people">Hire the Right People</h2>

<p><img src="/images/milton.jpg" alt="Milton Office Space" /></p>

<p>Hire people smarter than you and get out of their way.</p>

<p>See my other articles on <a href="/interview-strategies-a-technology-hiring-manager/">hiring technology professionals</a>.</p>

<h3 id="don-t-micromanage">Don&rsquo;t Micromanage</h3>

<p>Nuff said else failed previous item.</p>

<h2 id="understand-software-shelf-life">Understand Software Shelf Life</h2>

<h3 id="shelf-life-definition">Shelf Life Definition</h3>

<p>Software expiration has passed when both of the following criteria have been met:</p>

<ul>
<li>It no longer produces enough value to support the maintenance of the code</li>
<li>The proposed value from software improvements is less than the cost of the improvements</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="predict-the-futures">Predict The Futures</h3>

<p>Applying a timeline to the life of an application is hard. Not because one cannot estimate a project life, but because most are not truthful with themselves on the potential of their project.</p>

<p>Ass.u.mption: shoestring ultra-successful software lasts forever and will fix rare bugs later when money is pouring.</p>

<h3 id="yeah-fix-it-later">Yeah – Fix It Later</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fail the &ldquo;fix it later&rdquo; mentality. Sometimes disposable software is appropriate. If you only need to scrape a website once then just write a quick and dirty script and then archive it.</p>

<h3 id="plan-for-the-futures">Plan For The Futures</h3>

<p>We don&rsquo;t really know what the future holds for us, but we should plan for it. Ask this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where is this script stored and why?</li>
<li>Where is the documentation?</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is only stored locally and undocumented on someone&rsquo;s machine: fail++.</p>

<h2 id="bad-code-costs-moar">Bad Code Costs Moar</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no fix-it-later scenario.</li>
<li>There will be no point where you be chillin&rsquo; counting benjamins letting engineers scrub code</li>
<li>There is no pattern that fixes an anti-pattern</li>
<li>There is no way to pause the businesses for your migration</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only pick 2:</p>

<p><img src="/images/good-fast-cheap-venn-diagram.jpg" alt="Good Fast Cheap - Pick 2 - Venn Diagram" /></p>

<h3 id="what-is-bad-code">What is Bad Code</h3>

<p>This is a hard one to explain.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes biz pushes devs to deliver sooner than estimates, so they cut corners.</li>
<li>Sometimes coders are lazy or do not really want to be on a project business is pushing them to move faster on.</li>
<li>Sometimes coders are just not any good. You hired them so now it is a containment issue.</li>
<li>Have peer reviews and pull requests, and yes, that costs. See: <em>Outsourced cheap stuff</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="myth-of-the-parallel-rewrite">Myth of the Parallel Rewrite</h3>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Going to refactor legacy code</li>
<li>Also continuing development or maintaining the current code base</li>
<li>Not contributing more human or financial resources</li>
<li>Done in 1/10th the time that the original code base was developed</li>
<li>Macho Camacho for President!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software-development-lifecycle">Software Development Lifecycle</h2>

<p>A reasonable software lifecycle is imperative to delivering quality software.</p>

<p>No cycle == Bad mkay</p>

<h3 id="politics-of-the-lifecycle">Politics of The Lifecycle</h3>

<p>I intend to write at more length about the politics behind the product lifecycle.</p>

<p>Case study: There is no policy for a daily deployment to Curiosity rover on Mars and if the previous glitches are an indicator we can assume that even <a href="http://www.space.com/23553-mars-rover-curiosity-software-glitch.html">NASA has a high bug rate</a> when dealing with rapid product deployments.</p>

<h2 id="test-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-sacred-test">Test - For the Love of All That is Sacred, Test</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you do not have tests your software probably sucks</li>
<li>Tests indemnify engineers and build confidence</li>
<li>Broad set of tests == enjoy the weekend == morale</li>
<li>New features probably will not break existing functionality</li>
<li>If there are no tests then deployments are a crap shoot</li>
<li>Wide Coverage Is Safety</li>
<li>Estimate tests writing time</li>
<li>Know your tests</li>
<li>Damn the tests - DO IT LIVE!</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine this conversation:</p>

<p>Biz Guy - &ldquo;The super widget functionality I had you put in there last month is not working. What did you guys break?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Programmer - &ldquo;All tests are passing. I am looking and there are no tests covering any business requirements for such a feature. If you want we can take a look and write a test that covers this feature.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Build things that make the world better. Treat employees like people. Give back.</p>
