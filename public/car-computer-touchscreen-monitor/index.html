<div class=article-body><p>How do you control your new custom Linux powered car computer? With a touch screen monitor obviously. And maybe a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>I would like this to feel like I am using a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=steampunk">Steampunk</a> hacker version of a Tesla.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1093773_icon-helios-is-gorgeous-tesla-powered-electric-streamliner-concept&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla Streamliner Concept&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Well maybe not all that.</p>
<p>Maybe more like this:</p>
<pre><code>Race Truck Dash
</code></pre>
<h2 id=touch-screens>Touch Screens</h2>
<p>I started a similar project about 6 years ago on another vehicle. I wasn&rsquo;t able to get a monitor installed on that vehicle in the center and felt like it would be obstructive. Instead I put in a navigation system that was about 11" and placed it in front of the passenger. Since then Tesla Motors came out and made their entire center console a touch screen. Now I realize I can be obnoxious in the center of my console for no good reason and people will dig it.</p>
<pre><code>Tesla Dashboard
</code></pre>
<p>Honestly this is kinda ugly. It&rsquo;s just a huge monitor that doesn&rsquo;t fit into any design constraints. In car that is supposed to be pretty I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter. This is a perfect example of forcing a customer to compromise for functionality and not worrying about the art of it.</p>
<h2 id=feature-requirements>Feature Requirements</h2>
<p>This is pretty simple and I will try to rank my requirements by importance.</p>
<ol>
<li>durability</li>
<li>cost</li>
<li>size</li>
<li>power consumption</li>
<li>picture quality</li>
<li>HDMI</li>
</ol>
<p><em>In business parlance:</em> I am going to beat this up probably, but don&rsquo;t have a ton of money to spend on a super low power rugged military console. Besides those military and police ones have crappy screens and use proprietary connectors.</p>
<p>Nice to haves:</p>
<ul>
<li>big screen (gaming / videos)</li>
<li>speakers built-in (for adhoc usage)</li>
<li>auto sleep</li>
<li>dimmer</li>
<li>mountable case</li>
<li>durable shell</li>
<li>front facing controls</li>
<li>hidden plugs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=capacitive-vs-resistive-touchscreens>Capacitive vs. Resistive Touchscreens</h2>
<h4 id=a-capacitive-touchscreen>A capacitive touchscreen:</h4>
<p>A capacitive touchscreen is made of two layers of glass, coated with a conductive agent, like iridium tin oxide.
The conductor agent reacts to the touch of a human finger or special-tipped stylus on the screen. This causes a change in the local electrostatic field and indicates to the system exactly which area, number, or icon on the screen has been touched. A capacitive touchscreen also supports multi-touch—e.g., simultaneous pressing on an icon and enlargement of an image on the screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers easy, flexible operation.</li>
<li>Touts a higher degree of contrast and thus can be seen more easily.</li>
<li>Facilitates more accurate input.</li>
<li>Features enhanced durability.</li>
<li>Future-proof - becoming more popular</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A capacitive touchscreen that is scratched, pierced, or cracked will continue to operate. This can occur if employees try to operate the device with something other than their finger or stylus, if they tap the glass too hard, or if a mobile device is dropped. This is not true of a resistive touchscreen, which in most cases stops working whenever the surface is damaged.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id=resistive-touchscreen>Resistive Touchscreen</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is most widely accepted</li>
<li>It is less expensive</li>
<li>Reacts to multiple types of touch. gloved or ungloved fingers</li>
<li>More Sensitive</li>
</ul>
<p>A resistive touchscreen can also register input from a fine point of contact because it offers more sensors per inch than a capacitive touchscreen.</p>
<p>A resistive touchscreen is comprised of two flexible layers of material with a layer of air in between. It registers input (the precise location of the touch) when a small amount of pressure is exerted on the top layer, enough for it to make contact with the bottom layer. Because the two layers of material used in a resistive touchscreen are synthetic instead of glass, its surface is susceptible to scratching or wear than the surface of a capacitive touchscreen.</p>
<h5 id=i-chose-capacitive>I Chose Capacitive</h5>
<p>I thinks I am pretty much settled now. These are the two most popular and what I have access to choose from.</p>
<h2 id=screen-types---tft-vs-oled>Screen Types - TFT vs OLED</h2>
<p>The greatest portion of monitors are probably going to be Thin Film Transistor (TFT). Though there are some Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) monitors I didn&rsquo;t see any of them.</p>
<p><a href=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-a-tft-touch-screen>https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-a-tft-touch-screen</a></p>
<h2 id=optimal-size>Optimal Size</h2>
<p>Because this is going to be stuck in the middle of the console on the truck I need to keep it within a reasonable size. Originally I was going to use a Google Nexus 7, but things have evolved a lot since then. I think the max capacity for that area is 13" viewable. Ideally I think a 11" screen would do well.</p>
<h2 id=form-factor>Form Factor</h2>
<p>One of these Raspberry Pi modules would be great though they will come with quite a bit more work to fabricate a case for it. Also they don&rsquo;t tend to be very big.</p>

<p>At 7" there isn&rsquo;t a lot to be expected.</p>

<h4 id=can-i-buy-a-tesla-screen>Can I Buy A Tesla Screen</h4>
<p>I looked at a few Pi&rsquo;s before I decided to just see what was in the Tesla 3. Apparently on the open market they are going for north of $1300 right now. That is more than a good TV. People are crazy. And they are buying them in orders of 20k at a time.</p>
<pre><code>Tesla 3 Screen
</code></pre>
<p>It is a 15 inch screen however. And I love the night mode. It&rsquo;s always night mode for me.</p>

<h4 id=a-potential-loss>A Potential Loss</h4>
<p>This one had potential.</p>
<p>Then I read the specs.</p>
<p>Warm Tips :</p>
<ul>
<li>❤ The touch function ONLY can be used after monitor hooked up to pc with driver installed via USB cable.</li>
<li>❤ Driver download link (according to your computer system): <a href=http://www.eeti.com.tw/drivers_Win.html>http://www.eeti.com.tw/drivers_Win.html</a></li>
<li>❤ Video link for driver installation method : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmg8W9bxpvw&t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmg8W9bxpvw&t=4s</a></li>
<li>❤ Please do 4-point calibration before use touch function.</li>
</ul>
<p>This TOGUARD 10.1 inch IPS Touchscreen Monitor has a compact and sleek design for connecting with various applications such as laptop, game console, computer, CCTV security camera,etc. Ultra lightweight and slim for great portability, making it perfect for business presentations and the frequent traveler.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<h4 id=another-pi>Another Pi</h4>
<p>This one is a strong toss up.</p>
<p>At $175 it&rsquo;s not an easy decision</p>

<h5 id=bad-reviews>Bad Reviews</h5>
<p>After reading a ton of reviews I don&rsquo;t think I can trust myself with this. The touchscreen portion doesn&rsquo;t seem like I can get it out of the device and I would have to create my own case for it.</p>
<h3 id=a-car-monitor>A Car monitor</h3>
<pre><code>Car monitor
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>CAPACTIVE TOUCH SCREEN: This 10.1 inch touchscreen monitor uses capacitve touch panel, it’s more durable than resistive touch screen. Easy to operate by fingers without install any software. You will get more fun with entertainment</li>

</ul>
<p>Obviously this is a foreign made monitor. The information seems like ESL.</p>

<p>Virtual Screen:</p>
<p><a href=https://github.com/kbumsik/VirtScreen>https://github.com/kbumsik/VirtScreen</a></p>
<p>Yeah. This aint gonna happen.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This took a lot longer than I expected. But what I did learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The small form factor HDMI touch screen market is wiped out by the tablet market</li>
<li>Either small monitors are too small for hobbyists or too expensive and ugly for industrial apps</li>
<li>People still don&rsquo;t hack their car electronics because it&rsquo;s a ton of dark magic and mechanics are superstitious</li>
<li>We need to build more prototyping tools in the USA</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day I went with SunFounder because I felt like they might have a good prototype tool and their support department seemed to be responsive. If I made a mistake then I will purchase another smaller model and come back later.</p>
