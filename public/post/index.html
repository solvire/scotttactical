        Preface to Vehemenism We stand at the transition of an epoch. Either we are standing at the bottom of a cliff we may ascend, or at the precipice one, we will be pushed from. This &ldquo;we&rdquo; is addressing men alone. Only we are the ones presented with this unique problem. It is a problem of perspective and one that contains many recursive questions. The answer to these questions will ultimately decide whether or not the observer was indeed a man, to begin with.

        Test Drive: Mail In A Box TL;DR I set up Mail-in-a-Box and it was a quick and painless experience. Preface I am tired of managing so many gmail and outlook accounts. Those $5/mo bills really eat at me. So I wanted to try something simple. I got goosebumps when I saw this and had to try it. I&rsquo;ll also preface that I was a professional email list manager and built an email service platform that was sending/receiving greater than 20 million emails a day.

        Django And eCommerce TL;DR I setup Oscar as a demo ecommerce project in the previous post. Preface Backstory I just finished a post about setting up eCommerce with Python Django and wasn&rsquo;t totally pleased with the process. Also I don&rsquo;t think it is fair to only demo a single application. I decided to give Saleor my second slot after talking with several people online and looking through its source. The parent company has a number of nice products which was confidence building.

        Django And eCommerce TL;DR I like Python and want to use it for eCommerce, so I went through the well known products and settled on Oscar as my demo. It took a while to set up, but was pretty full featured. Python and Django still have to compete with short busses like wordpress and dump trucks like Magento, but I think these tools are ready for me to start pushing. Preface Let me say this took me almost 2 days to get through and evaluate, which I&rsquo;m used to having a demo site up in minutes.

        How To Install MapR Test Cluster This document covers my installation of MapR Converged Platform on an Ubuntu 14.04 cluster. We are running on the DTAC private cloud so some of the screenshots will show our internal interface. All instances are running in a VM. Most of this follows the suggested flow given in the lab manual from MapR. Initially I launched the cluster on CentOS 7.3 but that wasn&rsquo;t supported and it failed.

        Encrypt Your DB Backups I&rsquo;m mostly putting this here for my reference. I do this in multiple projects and always seem to forget where my instructions are.

Or not. I don&rsquo;t think it matters really. That will create the public and private keys. backup_key.pem - private key backup_key.pem.pub - public key Add AWS Keys Create a file to hold your AWS keys.

        The Waves of Technology Professional I like to consider 2001 the tail edge of the Internet bubble. It was a brutal time to be in a computer science field. There weren&rsquo;t many jobs. The jobs that were being squatted on were jealously guarded. I needed the one thing that nobody would provide. Experience. So instead I grinded projects and studied unceasingly. In 2001 I had to take a job as an &ldquo;integration specialist&rdquo;.

        Binding Multiple Terminals I am running on multiple servers all the time. And with DTAC doing testing of big data I obviously need to play with many servers at once.

Particularly iTerm2 that has some nice broadcasting.

        Writing in Markdown If you haven&rsquo;t used Markdown to write in a rich(er) text format, then you are missing out. I pretty much write all my technical documentation in Markdown. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome and I don&rsquo;t know why it took me so long to find it. I didn&rsquo;t start using it until around 2013. What is Markdown Markdown was created by John Gruber. According to Wikipedia. John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people &ldquo;to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)” What does that even mean?

        TL;DR OpenStack is a massive complicated ecosystem. It is only going to survive by the vendors that support it and probably not what you need. Backstory Let me begin by saying that given the proper talent pool, financial resources, and time; OpenStack probably isn&rsquo;t bad for some people. For most institutions it is just wrong. I will probably write another article that outlines all the questions that I should have asked before starting this.

        Text Search - Django Model Fields Django has a pretty flexible ORM, but sometimes clients need a free-form text search to get down to the content that you are looking for. It is beyond the capability of most engineers to build a comprehensive search tool and shoehorn it into an existing application. There are people working on these problems for years. This does remind me of a senior boss that asked me to add a fuzzy search field to an application and that it was &ldquo;super simple&rdquo;.

        This essay is not an attack on the people who claim membership to a philosophical outlook, but an exposition on the inherent difficulties which exist in maintaining traditional systems. Let us begin with the needful: term definition. Term Definition Conservatism as a political and social philosophy promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of the culture and civilization. This is the definition found at Wikipedia and I find it to be a pretty good summation of the idea.

        Download the Entire Site with wget If you don&rsquo;t have homebrew please install it. It will make all our lives easier. Howto This was kinda simple but I wanted to post it here for reference. On thing I would like to note is the wait and limit-rate. Make sure you don&rsquo;t trip any throttles or piss off any website owners by leaving the pipes wide open. wget \ --recursive \ --no-clobber \ --page-requisites \ --convert-links \ --wait=5 --limit-rate=20K \ --domains api.yoursite.com \ --no-parent \ http://api.yoursite.com/ Alternate you can run the mirror command wget -m --wait=5 http://test.com I am sure one can use lynx but this is what I like.

        In the Beginning There was the Web. World Wide actually. Well, before that there was something of AOL, Berners-Lee, DoD, DARPA, ARPANET and a prototype of Al Gore launching carrier pigeons down long tubes with fortune cookie-sized packets tied to their little legs addressed to: &ldquo;Wh@t_#hath_God_wr0ught?&ldquo;. Fast-forward: now we have Skynet. Well not yet, but soon. Hopefully. At least that is why I intend to generate favor with our future overlords by suggesting, at least locally, that certain systemic changes be encouraged so that their manifestation onto the stage be smooth and welcoming.

        Laravel 5 - Enforcing HTTPS I&rsquo;ve used a lot of frameworks. Laravel is great. Dealing with a load balancer Most of us are on a scaled service and most of us need HTTPS. It is much easier to put the SSL certificate on the load balancer and then proxy the request over port 80 to the actual server. It saves on CPU processes as well since the decryption work doesn&rsquo;t have to be performed on the slave boxes.

        Hypermedia for PHP APIs. Well, here it is. I&rsquo;m finally finishing up my Hypermedia layer for our Laravel 5.1 build.

In Production - Alpha Right now I have it in our very alpha phase version of the software running the LeadFerret business lead search system. The project is on github here: PHP Hypermedia API Layer for HATEOAS HTTP or REST Services It is slowly getting to where I would like it to be.

        Well, we got the truck running enough that I can drive it around. It stops. We even locked it up and watched the black lines form up behind the tires. Not bad for 35&rsquo;s. It was moved over to Camarillo to the shop known as Mercenary Offroad where a custom bumper will be fabricated for it. The designator for this bumper is also 001 as it will be the first one designed for this series truck.

        Here we go. 1969 hugger orange rust bucket. This thing barely stops. It stops when it wants to. So it&rsquo;s kinda like a woman. Every bushing and joint is shot. Probably never replaced a thing on it. And the adventure begins. I&rsquo;m using this truck as the first in my branded line of modified restorations.
