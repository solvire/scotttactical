        Deploying Hugo the Golang CMS on DigitalOcean Creating a Droplet I am a bit partial to CentOS. The lastest version as of this writing is CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core). Setting up a droplet is always very simple. Just turn it on basically. Upload your ssh keys. Done. Install Nginx Add the epel repo: yum install epel-release Install yum install nginx Start it service nginx start systemctl enable nginx Create the Folders mkdir -p /var/www/ursite/ chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www touch /var/www/ursite/index.html - or clone your site cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/ursite Configure nginx open the config file: vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/virtual.conf Add the following: # # A virtual host using mix of IP-, name-, and port-based configuration # server { listen 80; server_name scotttactical.com; server_alias go.scotttactical.com; location / { root /var/www/stac/public/; index index.html; } } Install Go + Hugo yum install go I decided to install from source Edit your bash script to have the proper variables in place.

        Hiking Yosemite, CA &nbsp; Rimrise and Shine Mornings in Yosemite Valley are breathtaking. The weather was perfect IMO. We had some unfortunate luck with the camping and as you can see we could not get duplicate nights on our spot. See our note on getting your site well in advance. Our wonderful neighbors were kind enough to help us out. They got us from the upper pines campsites out around the valley and back to the trailhead of the 4 mile trail.

        If I stacked pennies from the ground to the top of the Empire State Bldg, would they all fit into this room? Firstly dear sir, you do not have that many pennies. Secondly if you cash it in for large bills then they all fit in your pocket. It is a question like this that would make me decide alternatively in my career choice. However I see tech managers searching for really “smart” interview questions and white board problems in an attempt to stump the prospective employee.

Howto This was kinda simple but I wanted to post it here for reference. On thing I would like to note is the wait and limit-rate. Make sure you don&rsquo;t trip any throttles or piss off any website owners by leaving the pipes wide open. wget \ --recursive \ --no-clobber \ --page-requisites \ --convert-links \ --wait=5 --limit-rate=20K \ --domains api.yoursite.com \ --no-parent \ http://api.yoursite.com/ Alternate you can run the mirror command wget -m --wait=5 http://test.com I am sure one can use lynx but this is what I like.

        Laravel 5 - Enforcing HTTPS [][1] I&rsquo;ve used a lot of frameworks. Laravel is great. Dealing with a load balancer Most of us are on a scaled service and most of us need HTTPS. It is much easier to put the SSL certificate on the load balancer and then proxy the request over port 80 to the actual server. It saves on CPU processes as well since the decryption work doesn&rsquo;t have to be performed on the slave boxes.

For about 20 or so years we have been collectively building sophisticated network interfaces for humans. The most advanced interface is the web browser.

        Cleaned up the trans a little bit. Tiny bit of cosmetics. Taped up. Then hit it with some nice paint. I prefer for these to have paint. Keeps cleaning it easier. Also I think the buyer will appreciate it. Before: After: &nbsp; A fun fact, this and a few of the Chevy transmissions have a prestigious history. Chevy C/K Trucks Suburban (this one we have) Hummer H1/H2 Rolls Royce Bentley Jaguar Source This is one of my favorite transmissions.

        Just got the trans in from Brad at Transaction Transmission. I have used him for a while now and he puts in the effort. Components were upgraded and everything set new. This should be strong for the newowner. It was cleaned and painted at the shop but I am going to clean it up a little more and put on a coat of the &ldquo;Mercenary Offroad&rdquo; package graphite gray.

        Well, we got the truck running enough that I can drive it around. It stops. We even locked it up and watched the black lines form up behind the tires. Not bad for 35&rsquo;s. It was moved over to Camarillo to the shop known as Mercenary Offroad where a custom bumper will be fabricated for it. The designator for this bumper is also 001 as it will be the first one designed for this series truck.

        So the PO was rough on the vehicle. Probably multiple PO&rsquo;s. Included are some pictures to show the detail we went to in repairing and rebuilding the brake systems. The brake system had been WORKED. They were pretty much shot. When we got it the pedal hit the floor. It didn&rsquo;t want to stop so the ride to the shop was a bit of a terror show for that 2 miles.

        Here we go. 1969 hugger orange rust bucket. This thing barely stops. It stops when it wants to. So it&rsquo;s kinda like a woman. Every bushing and joint is shot. Probably never replaced a thing on it. And the adventure begins. I&rsquo;m using this truck as the first in my branded line of modified restorations. Our focus for these trucks is somewhere in between utility and aesthetics. Not just a mall crawler but something of a useful truck that also gets attention.
