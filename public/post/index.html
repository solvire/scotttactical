  <div class="summary">Text Search - Django Model Fields Django has a pretty flexible ORM, but sometimes clients need a free-form text search to get down to the content that you are looking for. It is beyond the capability of most engineers to build a comprehensive search tool and shoehorn it into an existing application. There are people working on these problems for years.
This does remind me of a senior boss that asked me to add a fuzzy search field to an application and that it was &ldquo;super simple&rdquo;.</div>

  <div class="summary">Just got the trans in from Brad at Transaction Transmission.
I have used him for a while now and he puts in the effort. Components were upgraded and everything set new. This should be strong for the newowner. It was cleaned and painted at the shop but I am going to clean it up a little more and put on a coat of the &ldquo;Mercenary Offroad&rdquo; package graphite gray.

  <div class="summary">Well, we got the truck running enough that I can drive it around. It stops. We even locked it up and watched the black lines form up behind the tires. Not bad for 35&rsquo;s.
It was moved over to Camarillo to the shop known as Mercenary Offroad where a custom bumper will be fabricated for it. The designator for this bumper is also 001 as it will be the first one designed for this series truck.</div>

  <div class="summary">So the PO was rough on the vehicle. Probably multiple PO&rsquo;s.
Included are some pictures to show the detail we went to in repairing and rebuilding the brake systems.
The brake system had been WORKED. They were pretty much shot. When we got it the pedal hit the floor. It didn&rsquo;t want to stop so the ride to the shop was a bit of a terror show for that 2 miles.</div>

  <div class="summary">Here we go.
1969 hugger orange rust bucket.
This thing barely stops. It stops when it wants to. So it&rsquo;s kinda like a woman. Every bushing and joint is shot. Probably never replaced a thing on it.
And the adventure begins. I&rsquo;m using this truck as the first in my branded line of modified restorations. Our focus for these trucks is somewhere in between utility and aesthetics. Not just a mall crawler but something of a useful truck that also gets attention.</div>
