<h2 id="why-it-needs-help-my-letter">Why It Needs Help - My Letter</h2>

<p>This is an open letter to the Covered California website designer, administrators, bureaucrats and contractors.</p>

<h2 id="website-design-and-usability">Website Design and Usability</h2>

<p>I have several things listed below. Things I find to be of poor design or just plain broken.</p>

<h3 id="you-don-t-got-mail">You Don&rsquo;t Got Mail!</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Secure Mailbox (2)&rdquo; even though nothing was in my mail box.</p></li>

<li><p>It randomly logged me out.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="go-on-click-me-if-ya-can">GO&rsquo;ON CLICK ME IF YA CAN</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I am low on time for open enrollment and it gave me a &ldquo;Pay Now&rdquo; button in order to do it faster, but the button was broken. It would pop up and then if I tried to pay it would throw a JavaScript error in my console and close out. Now I can&rsquo;t pay. It&rsquo;s weird when people don&rsquo;t want my money.</p></li>

<li><p>The page refreshing on every submission of information is mind numbing. Just cache it. Or make the template more clean. Or make it more responsive.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="all-your-accounts-all-belong-to-us">All your accounts all belong to us!</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>My Account section has almost nothing about what plans I selected. I am glad I was taking screenshots along the way. How do you guys even know what I selected. Isn&rsquo;t there a table with a key that can simply show what my plans look like? How do I get back to that information? It shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard. Do you even care about me getting to my coverage?</p></li>

<li><p>You sent me zero email notifications based on what I was signing up for. And I specifically put that email was my preferred contact method. Instead you handed it off to someone else and washed your hands. They will be mailing me things. I don&rsquo;t go to my mailbox every day. It&rsquo;s a drive. I&rsquo;m not some home loafer who waits by his mailbox.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="penrose-navigation">Penrose Navigation</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The layout of the pages is all wrong. It&rsquo;s got too much nonsense on it. Right hand home page &ldquo;extra&rdquo; navigation is hard to see and nonintuitive.</p></li>

<li><p>You have an informational video on the bottom left barely under the fold. Why? Shouldn&rsquo;t there be an info section or a knowledge base. Just use another website for an example.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-are-up-100-of-the-time-50-of-the-day">We are up 100% of the time 50% of the day!</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Work on reliability. The site will be down or throwing errors half the time I got through.</p></li>

<li><p>It took me 5 tries to actually get through this whole process.  It was painful. No commercial company would survive this.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-not-home">We Not Home</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Why do you make me fill in 8!!! lines of information to start a live chat. Seriously. If I am logged in just open the chat window and start talking. Is this a game? Don&rsquo;t make me mask my phone number with special characters&hellip; Especially if you know it&rsquo;s going to just be integers.  (###) ###-#####  no! I don&rsquo;t like that format. I use dots because i&rsquo;m not older than 50 and know how to use a 10key. What if I was doing this on a mobile device. Have you even watched Office Space? Do you want someone to red stapler your website?</p></li>

<li><p>Why is &ldquo;report a change&rdquo; hovering in some dead zone where a lady and a baby are. Is that lady and baby supposed to make me think men don&rsquo;t apply or that I should be taking out more coverage because there are family health issues at stake here. Report a change should show up when you log in. Just get people to log in and then present the info in order.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="navigation-as-path-not-choices">Navigation as Path not Choices</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The ordering of your navigation is not industry best practices.</p></li>

<li><p>On the right&hellip; those options? Some are grayed out. You aren&rsquo;t looking at this the right way. It is highly confusing. Are they headers or do they just disappear? If they are disabled why? Why can&rsquo;t I discontinue any time?</p></li>

<li><p>You need to control state on your navigation. For instance: if i am signed up and you dont&rsquo; want to show &ldquo;select a plan&rdquo; and instead make &ldquo;change plan&rdquo; the path then you dont&rsquo; leave &ldquo;select a plan&rdquo; still there and just gray it out. Why? If it&rsquo;s not available then remove it. It&rsquo;s like when you are editing something you don&rsquo;t have two buttons for create and save next to each other and just gray out  create. You remove it. It&rsquo;s not relevant or part of the user state.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="loco-help">Loco Help</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>BTW I tried the &ldquo;Find Local Help&rdquo; button and all the people I called on that suggested list said they don&rsquo;t help with Medical or Covered CA. I&rsquo;m not sure what your intention is there.</p></li>

<li><p>The &ldquo;Español ▼&rdquo; dropdown should actually be a drop down. I went to click on espanol and it just changed the language instead of actually giving me the drop down. You are doing double duty on that field and it&rsquo;s misleading.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mobiles-need-not-apply">Mobiles Need Not Apply</h3>

<ul>
<li>This website is NOT mobile friendly.  Big sin buddies. Are none of your constituents under 30?</li>
</ul>

<p>That is pretty much all I picked up today.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Stop hiring crony consultants and design firms. Give respectable shops a chance to do it right. You might actually save some money and have some customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>Just my .02</p>
