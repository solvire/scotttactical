<h2 id="test-drive-mail-in-a-box">Test Drive: Mail In A Box</h2>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I set up <a href="https://mailinabox.email/">Mail-in-a-Box</a> and it was a quick and painless experience.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>I am tired of managing so many gmail and outlook accounts. Those $5/mo bills really eat at me. So I wanted to try something simple. I got goosebumps when I saw this and had to try it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also preface that I was a professional email list manager and built an email service platform that was sending/receiving greater than 20 million emails a day. This is obviously much different, but it&rsquo;s cool to work in low volume transactional environments. I also hate HATE managing email.</p>

<h2 id="pre-setup">Pre-setup</h2>

<p>Here are a couple details about my stack.</p>

<p>I am hosting on <a href="http://dtac.io">http://dtac.io</a> cloud VPS with the following specs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</li>
<li>2GB memory</li>
<li>40GB HD</li>
<li>1 local private ip</li>
<li>1 public ip</li>
<li>1 ipv6 public</li>
<li>1 piv6 private</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/mib1.png" alt="DTAC Cloud Instance" /></p>

<p>Make sure to update ubuntu with all the latest fixes. My SSH keys and all that stuff were already deployed with my personal images.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s Begin</p>

<h2 id="domain-configuration">Domain Configuration</h2>

<p>I am using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon AWS SES</a> on their free tier to handle the transactional outgoing email, so this is mostly for incoming mail. If you have dealt with deliverability this is a huge thing for me.</p>

<p>I am also using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Amazon Route 53</a> for managing the DNS. It&rsquo;s free and I don&rsquo;t want to deal with name servers.</p>

<p>I created an A record for box.theduber.club to my IP. I then set the hostname of the box locally. Make sure to set up reverse DNS as well. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route-53-reverse-dns/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route-53-reverse-dns/</a></p>

<p>Waiting for your ISP to get rDNS might be the longest thing.</p>

<p>For those who wrote the documentation. It was dialed down a little much. It actually took longer to set up because of the dummyproofing that was going on.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>As root:</p>

<pre><code>curl -s https://mailinabox.email/setup.sh | sudo bash
</code></pre>

<p>It gave me a nice TUI to go through graphic-ish setup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mib2.png" alt="DTAC Cloud Instance" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/mib3.png" alt="DTAC Cloud Instance" /></p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>You should be able to log into your console. <a href="https://box.yourdomain.com/admin">https://box.yourdomain.com/admin</a></p>

<p>It will tell you what it is missing. The <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> feature is great. Totally love that part! Seriously, it saves days of my life.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m totally into this. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mailinabox">https://twitter.com/mailinabox</a> for all the great work compiling this thing.</p>
