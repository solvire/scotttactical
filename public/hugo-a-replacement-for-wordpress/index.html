<h2 id="hugo-a-replacement-for-wordpress">Hugo: A Replacement for Wordpress</h2>

<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<ul>
<li>I researched go</li>
<li>Found Hugo</li>
<li>Setup a test</li>
<li>Migrated my Wordpress instance</li>
<li>Launched DigitalOcean Droplet</li>
<li>Deployed</li>
</ul>

<p>Total time: <em>6 hours</em></p>

<h3 id="continued">Continued:</h3>

<p>My problems started almost a year before I took up this cause. At the time I only had 2 Wordpress sites. Very very low traffic.  Only a couple users a day.  They were mostly place holders for business sites.</p>

<h3 id="wordpress-is-hungry">Wordpress is hungry</h3>

<p>What was annoying about the case was that they would randomly <em>carsh</em>! I realized they were running <em>out of memory</em>. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why because I just wouldn&rsquo;t let myself believe that a couple instances of Wordpress were enough to run out of memory. It was an AWS box running with .5GB of memory and some swap space. I can&rsquo;t remember what. Maybe I was just too optimistic.</p>

<p>I reimaged the server, installed several performance plugins, cached anything I could, but still it would eat memory like a lonely fat girl at a buffet. Every couple days my monitor would go off telling me the site was down. The monitor wasn&rsquo;t in place immediately because I didn&rsquo;t think I needed one. It was only after the site had been offline for a couple days before I realized that I had to get a monitor.</p>

<p>Well eventually I decided it just needed more hardware. I went to 1G of memory for the 2 instances. That carshed as well. It was like watching the movie Carsh in slow motion. I added a couple gigs of swap, but then aws started acting funny and it would fill up the memory immediately. I then went to 2G ram and 2G of swap. Still - Carshon Daily show!</p>

<h3 id="it-s-the-future-already">It&rsquo;s the Future Already</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s 2015. In honor of 2015 and #BackToTheFuture day I am getting over 2000&rsquo;s technology and moving on to something new.</p>

<p><em>Blogs should fast and light</em> and should be able to run in the fog. Static, and with out short codes. Gawd! And hoverboards.</p>

<h2 id="so-starts-my-late-journey">So Starts My (Late) Journey</h2>

<h3 id="my-requirements">My Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Easy markup (or markdown)</li>
<li>Lite - less than 500M of memory required</li>
<li>Static (optional but nice)</li>
<li>No DB or a lighter option</li>
<li>Image manipulation or gallery ease</li>
<li>Simple enough a business person can (ha this isn&rsquo;t the future you are looking for)</li>
<li>Authentication layers</li>
<li>SEO items

<ul>
<li>Sitemap</li>
<li>Metatags</li>
<li>Links</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multiple environment friendly (dev/stage/prod)</li>
<li>PERFORMANT fast</li>
<li>Templates (market)</li>
<li>Multi-site management (please?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="languages-prepared-to-flamed">Languages - PREPARED TO FLAMED!</h3>

<ul>
<li>PHP - too slow - boring - part of my problem already</li>
<li>Python - Interesting but everyone wants to use django. Kinda heavy for this</li>
<li>Ruby - pretty good but still kinda foreign to me</li>
<li>Go - I wanna learn it but where are the projects</li>
<li>Java - swatting at flies with a sledge hammer</li>
<li>Scala - eh&hellip; i liked this idea but still too big</li>
<li>C++ - Not a masochist</li>
<li>Perl - Not unless you say perl in a French accent every time</li>
<li>Node.js - I will not allow JS on my backend, it&rsquo;s unnatural</li>
</ul>

<p>Given my above list of languages I kinda forced myself into a sector.</p>

<h4 id="languages-decisions">Languages - Decisions</h4>

<h5 id="ruby">Ruby</h5>

<p>I really liked <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">jekyll</a> and might have gone with it if Ruby wasn&rsquo;t such a foreign concept to me. And I haven&rsquo;t decided if I want to jump in and learn it completely. So not this time gems.</p>

<h5 id="a-shot-at-python">A Shot at Python</h5>

<p>I have a ton of experience with PHP. They are all about the same. They can get okay performance if you cache everything but they are just too heavy. And it&rsquo;s PHP. I&rsquo;m over it. Drupal. Seriously it&rsquo;s 2015. That thing should have died 10 years ago.  Are you still driving your subaru brat?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used python before and I did give it a good run, but <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is just too big IMO. A blog is simple. It needs to stay simple. Plus they are trying to recreate Wordpress in all of its glory. No thanks.</p>

<p>To be fair to python, I spent a little time going through the implementation of <a href="http://mezzanine.jupo.org/">Mezzanine</a> and <a href="http://www.django-cms.org/en/">Django-CMS</a>.  Still. Too grande.</p>

<h5 id="java-et-al">Java et al</h5>

<p>I have spent time before researching Java and C++ CMS programs. They are probably okay for monolithic enterprises who need some sort of back stroking to know they used a dump truck with a Cadillac interior to go pick up the groceries.  When 500 people will be working on it and you need a 20 step approval process I guess. I digress.</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-go">Starting with Go</h2>

<p>Ok fine. Maybe now&rsquo;s my chance to play with <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>. I was looking for a project for it so let&rsquo;s give this a try.</p>

<p>So far my implementation ideas are:
- roll my own
- wrap up a framework
- use a designed blog framework</p>

<h3 id="some-frameworks">Some Frameworks</h3>

<p>I really liked a few of the frameworks, but as time went on I decided to see if I could find something lighter. But for records sake here are the samples I looked at</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://revel.github.io/">http://revel.github.io/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://beego.me/">http://beego.me/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://martini.codegangsta.io/">http://martini.codegangsta.io/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>BTW: Martini looked really cool. Light learning curve. I almost went with that, but felt like I could find better features in a purpose built app.</p>

<h3 id="a-blog-solution">A Blog Solution</h3>

<p>After meandering around with the frameworks I felt like I wanted to try something more stripped down. So I looked at micro sites and Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/">https://gohugo.io/</a> stood out.  I figured I would know in a couple hours if it work work or not.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-quick-start">Hugo: Quick Start</h2>

<p>Installing go is awesome on mac. If you have a mac and do not have <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> - shame on you.</p>

<pre><code>brew install go
</code></pre>

<p>Installing hugo as awesome.</p>

<pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre>

<p>Creating a new site was extremely simple.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir newsite
cd newsite
hugo new site .
hugo new about.md
hugo new post/first.md
git clone https://github.com/dim0627/hugo_theme_beg themes/beg
</code></pre>

<p>Edit <code>config.yaml</code> &ndash; see my example
Add <code>theme = &quot;beg&quot;</code></p>

<p>Start the serve:</p>

<pre><code>hugo server --buildDrafts --watch
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was very painless. I am kinda surprised. I was a little hesitant to get in here. Setting up virtual hosts and getting the code out there wasn&rsquo;t elegant but wasn&rsquo;t hard either. I just checked out my repo on the server.</p>

<p>I am going to start transfering some of my other blogs to this when I have the chance. I might even do something sophisticated to the sites that are more or dynamic or colorful.</p>

<p>Go Golang!</p>
