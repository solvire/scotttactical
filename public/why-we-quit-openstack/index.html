<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>OpenStack is a massive complicated ecosystem. It is only going to survive by the vendors that support it and probably not what you need.</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>Let me begin by saying that given the proper talent pool, financial resources, and time; OpenStack probably isn&rsquo;t bad for some people. For most institutions it is just <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>I will probably write another article that outlines all the questions that I should have asked before starting this. My assumptions were not all quite valid, but I did have a sneaking suspicion given a couple very relevant experiences.</p>

<p>Several people asked me about a way to do big(ish) data at an affordable price. I enjoy owning hardware and infrastructure and from a business perspective that is a fairly decent endeavor in terms of static equity. I was bored with coding. The two of those items intersected and I decided to take on the task of bringing in some data clients and see if I could beat the services of other competitors and give them a better experience.</p>

<p>Disclosure: This site is currently running on our openstack deployment in <a href="http://dtac.io">DTAC&rsquo;s</a> private cloud</p>

<p>.
.</p>

<p><img src="/images/full_openstack.jpg" alt="Full OpenStack" /></p>

<h2 id="red-flags">Red Flags</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Where there are <em>clouds</em> of smoke, there is probably fire. - An Indian Truism</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="it-took-forever">It Took Forever</h3>

<p>I witnessed an ambitious project slide face-first into the blue and white parking stall of the private cloud mall. Then later it was used as leverage to out every participant. I mostly attributed the breakdown to lack of time resources, OS talent and political infighting.  <em>nerds (heart) aws</em> but more on that elsewhere.  Ignoring those huge red flags I figured my sysadmin abilities would be able to figure things out and surpass them.</p>

<p>My response: I got sysadmin skills and no politics. I&rsquo;ve never failed to raise a datacenter infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="openstack-hate-speech">OpenStack Hate Speech</h3>

<p>There was plenty of hating over OpenStack. More specifically there was a lot of negative commentary about Nova, Neutron and Cinder. Basically the heart of the application.</p>

<p>My response: I kinda need those bells and whistles so it&rsquo;s worth dealing with monolithic bloat because that&rsquo;s my only option.</p>

<h3 id="nerds-heart-aws">Nerds (heart) AWS</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>When there is blood in the streets, buy land. - Contrarian Invetors&rsquo; Proverb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Searching for OpenStack talent was like looking for unbiased political commentary on twitter. Just ain&rsquo;t there.  Techs not only didn&rsquo;t know it well, but most applicants that had it on their resumes didn&rsquo;t want to deploy it. Out of 50 techs I talked with about private cloud work, 49 said they could help me set up with Amazon AW$.  It is entirely confusing to ask someone to help you with your private cloud and they offer to help what is essentially a competing public cloud.</p>

<p>A side note: Most tech professionals also said they were getting a &ldquo;great deal&rdquo; at Amazon. No financial officer I talked to shared this sentiment. I&rsquo;m sure business math was never part of comp-sci. Food for thought.</p>

<p>My response: Well most nerds have near-0 business strategy. Also this indicates there is a massive gap in talent so I&rsquo;d like to be here.</p>

<h3 id="babylon-fortuna-ergo-enterprise-ready">Babylon Fortuna ergo Enterprise-Ready</h3>

<p>The codebase is huge. And kinda old at this point. In internet years it&rsquo;s about 50 years old.</p>

<p>My response: It is mature enough to use. I should be ashamed of myself. I deployed IBM Websphere and should have known better.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-complicated">It is Complicated</h3>

<p><img src="/images/fb_complicated.png" alt="It's Complicated" /></p>

<p>Look at the diagram. Seriously Siri WHERE IS MY CAR!?!?!</p>

<p><img src="http://docs.openstack.org/icehouse/training-guides/content/figures/5/a/figures/openstack-arch-havana-logical-v1.jpg" alt="OpenStack" /></p>

<p>BTW this image is taken from the OpenStack &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; section.</p>

<p>My response: Well, shit. Guess I&rsquo;ve dealt with worse. I hope there isn&rsquo;t magic happening. I&rsquo;ll trust the Fuel installers. Oh God Fuel! don&rsquo;t fail me!</p>

<h3 id="it-is-fragile">It Is Fragile</h3>

<p>Refer to the previous diagram. With so many moving parts and given the lack of talent capable of managing it there is a serious level of risk in trusting a critical production environment on this.</p>

<p>My response: Keep my public cloud fail overs built and ready to deploy. I&rsquo;m a cheat.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-vendor-driven">It Is Vendor Driven</h3>

<p>I kinda knew that the growth of OpenStack was tainted by vendor intrigue. I have run into this spending a considerable amount of time working with OAuth 2.0 when the &ldquo;framework&rdquo; was going through proposals and the lead writers were splitting.</p>

<p>Cite: <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/summit-videos/presentation/openstack-is-doomed-and-it-is-your-fault">OpenStack is Doomed - Andy (termie) Smith</a></p>

<p>My response: Ick</p>

<h2 id="the-final-decision">The Final Decision</h2>

<p>While it might work for a team like RackSpace, I don&rsquo;t think it fits what we need. The cost benefit of having a few drivers and some prebuilt scripts to managing images wasn&rsquo;t enough to justify the cost and risk of having a system that is so fragile.</p>

<p>The risk and the knowns of unknowns inside the massive spaghetti of scope creep was enough that I couldn&rsquo;t justify that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to jump in and fix something within less than a day. Pretty much every code fix I had to make took more than a day. More of 3-5 days to figure out each bug. That was the last straw.</p>

<h3 id="opennebula">OpenNebula</h3>

<p>We tried other stacks and I launched a multiple node infrastructure with OpenNebula. It was refreshingly vertical and self-contained. But still felt like it wanted to follow the hypervisor slipstream of OpenStack.</p>

<h3 id="blah-stack">Blah-Stack</h3>

<p>There was a lot of other options but I was burned out at this point.</p>

<h3 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h3>

<p>The focus internally is more on bare-metal and OS containers. So far so good.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no free ride. (Development is an Expect 2 Work Employment)</li>
<li>Swiss army knives suck for self-defense and bayonets</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t expect to launch a cloud out of the box that will fit your business needs</li>
<li>If you believe the marketing - baaah</li>
<li>Community first, politics last</li>
